with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all . [ pos tagging ] IN RB JJ NNS TO VB IN , NNS VBP PRP RB JJ TO VB IN DT .
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ re@@ ment plans . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB PRP CD RB JJ NN IN DT : DT NN WDT VBD VBN IN NNS IN JJ NN NNS .
a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBD NN TO NN NNS IN NN , DT JJ JJ NN NN IN IN DT CD NNS CC IN CD JJ NNS .

you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te than if you only offer five . why ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP CD NNS : CD NN JJR NNS VB IN IN PRP RB VBP CD . WRB .
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow . [ pos tagging ] IN IN CD NNS TO VB IN , PRP VBZ RB RB JJ TO VB WDT NN TO VB IN PRP MD RB VB PRP RP IN NN .

understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .

so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBZ DT NN IN VBG RB JJ NNS .
and i think it makes the world look like this . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP PRP VBZ DT NN NN IN DT .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ? [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP TO VB DT NN RB IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN , RB .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' VBP TO VB DT JJ JJ NN , CC RB DT JJ JJ NN .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .

one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .

and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NNS MD VB NNS IN JJ NNS , CC PRP VBZ VBG TO VB WP PRP VBP VBG RBR JJ .

i wear je@@ ans almost all the time . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP NNS RB PDT DT NN .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and was@@ hed them enough times , they started to feel ok .

he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN WP DT VBD , IN JJ VBD DT NN VBG IN PDT DT NNS NNS , CC VB VBD IN IN DT NN : NN . : IN DT JJ NNS NN VBD RB VBN .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD JJR . PDT DT NN VBD PRP JJ IN PRP TO VB JJR .
but i felt worse . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBD RBR .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself . [ pos tagging ] WRB . NN VBD DT JJ NN TO VB TO VB DT TO VB .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBD RBR VBZ IN , IN DT IN DT NNS JJ , PRP$ NNS IN WRB JJ DT NN IN NNS MD VB VBD RB .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RB JJ : NN VBD DT JJ NNS WRB PRP RB VBD IN CD NN .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBD IN CD NNS , NN PRP , CD IN PRP MD VBP VBN JJ .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . [ pos tagging ] CC WP NN VBD VBD JJ , CC PRP VBZ JJ NN .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBN WP VBZ VBD TO WP NN VBN , CC WP NN VBD VBD VBG IN NN TO WP NN VBD .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be . [ pos tagging ] VBG NNS TO NNS POS NNS MD VB NN CC VB DT NNS NNS VBP IN WRB JJ DT NNS MD VB .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results . [ pos tagging ] CC WP DT VBZ VBG TO VB VBZ JJR NN IN NNS , RB WRB PRP VBP JJ NNS .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about . [ pos tagging ] NN IN DT NN IN NN NNS DT , IN IN PRP VBD , PRP VBP '' DT VBP WP DT VBD RB .
the truth is more like this . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ RBR IN DT .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBD RBR RB WRB NN VBD JJR VBZ IN WRB NN VBD JJR , PRP VBD RB JJ IN NNS TO VB NNS WDT VBD DT JJ NN .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be . [ pos tagging ] NNS , DT NN PRP VBP IN : PRP VBP , JJ NNS , IN NN DT NN : DT JJS PRP MD RB VB IN VBZ DT NN VBZ RB JJ IN PRP VBP PRP TO VB .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB RB JJ IN PRP$ NNS , PRP$ NNS , VBP VBN IN DT NN .

i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t se@@ ttle . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP NNS VBP VBN RBR . JJ VBP POS NN .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing . [ pos tagging ] CC VBG JJ CD RB PDT DT JJ NN .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?

when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ? [ pos tagging ] WRB EX VBP NNS IN JJ NNS IN NNS JJ , CC PRP VBP CD WDT VBZ JJ , CC PRP VBP WRB , WP VBZ JJ .
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN TO DT NN VBZ PRP .
you could have done better . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB VBN RBR .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure . [ pos tagging ] IN DT CD JJ NNS IN NNS IN NN , EX VBZ DT NN IN NN .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WRB NNS VBP NNS , CC RB IN DT NNS IN DT NNS VBP JJ , PRP VBP JJ IN PRP : PRP VBP PRP .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .

and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT JJ NN VBZ IN PRP VBP RB IN JJ , RB , CC PRP VBP JJR .
so let me re@@ mind you . [ pos tagging ] RB VB PRP VB PRP .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN , DT NN WDT PRP DT VBP TO VB JJ , CC PRP VBZ DT JJ . PRP VBZ RB JJ .

there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT JJ NN . JJ VBP POS VBP WP PRP VBZ .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ JJ IN PRP VBP JJ IN VBN DT NN WRB NNS VB PRP$ NN .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN NN : NN VBP RB VBN : IN DT NN NN , DT NN TO VB RB VBZ DT : WP VBZ DT IN DT NN IN JJ NNS VBZ JJ NN .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP NNS IN NNS IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP VBN IN JJ IN PRP , WRB PRP$ NN VBZ RB IN PRP VBP RB JJ NN .

&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels . [ pos tagging ] `` WP VBZ NN . `` VBZ NN IN JJ VBP JJ NNS VBP VBN VBG TO VB IN JJ NNS .

we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .

this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .

we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ TO VB RP IN DT NN IN CD NNS IN IN DT CD CC RB IN VBP RB .
when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .

so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD DT JJ NN RB VBD TO RB VB DT NN IN PRP MD VB DT NNS TO VB DT IN DT RBS JJ NNS .

can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ? [ pos tagging ] MD VB NN VBG DT RB JJ NNS WRB PRP VBP RB VBN IN .

a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material . [ pos tagging ] DT NN , IN DT NN , VBZ RB DT NN IN JJ JJ NN .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP$ NN IN VBG NN VBZ VBN VBG IN DT JJ NN .

we started this over 15 years ago . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT IN CD NNS RB .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ NNS , IN NN , VBG IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBD DT JJ NNS .
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing dna is very difficult . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RP VBG NN VBZ RB JJ .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .

so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rect all the er@@ r@@ ors . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN VBG DT JJ NNS RB CC VB PDT DT NNS .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD PRP$ JJ NN , VBG IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN NN .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN WDT VBZ NNS .
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NNS , VBD IN PRP$ NN NN CC VBD DT NN NN IN IN CD NNS .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .

but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .

design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ JJ , CC IN PRP VBP VBG IN JJ NN IN DT NN , IN JJ NN VBZ TO VB RB JJ .

so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN TO VB RP NNS , NNS , NNS .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT PRP VBD VBD VB PRP .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBD JJ RB VBD RB NN .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NNS IN PRP MD RB VB RB IN NNS : EX VBP NNS IN VBP PRP CC VB PRP RB .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD VBG NNS , VBG IN NNS WDT VBD CD TO CD NNS , VBD DT NNS TO VB JJ NNS , RB VBD NNS IN DT VBG RB TO CD .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP VBD RP DT NNS IN NN IN PRP MD VB PRP IN PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT NN WDT VBZ RB JJ IN PRP MD VB IN DT NN .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG TO VB TO DT NN IN NN .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ IN DT NN NN .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .

you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN , PRP$ NN RB VBZ JJ RB .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before . [ pos tagging ] NN TO CD NNS RB , PRP VBD PRP RP RB RB IN PRP VBD RB .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS IN NNS WDT MD VB DT .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS MD VB RB VBN : PRP MD VB IN DT NN .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP RB JJ IN NN MD VB IN JJ NN , VBP RB , VB DT JJ JJ NN .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , NN VBZ VBN DT NN IN DT VBZ RP RB .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .

this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT NN NN : DT VBZ RB DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscop@@ e . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ DT JJ NN PRP MD VB PRP IN DT JJ NN .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP NNS IN IN DT JJ NN .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ DT NN PRP VBD RB DT JJ NN RB .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN CD NNS IN JJ NN : PRP VBZ DT JJS NN RB VBN IN NNS IN DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN CD CD JJ NN .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD PRP RP IN DT CD NN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ CD NNS RB TO VB DT JJ NN .
well , how do we boot up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ? [ pos tagging ] RB , WRB VBP PRP VB RP DT NN . WRB VBP PRP VB DT .
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN PRP VBZ JJ NN : PRP VBZ RB RBR JJ VBG IN NNS .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB NN WRB PRP VBP IN NNS IN NNS : PRP MD RB VB RP DT NN CC NN IN DT CD , CC DT VBZ WP PRP VBP DT NN IN IN NN .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS CC NN , DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN , CC PRP RB VBD IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN CD NN TO DT CC VB PRP .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .

the new chromo@@ some went into the cell . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBD IN DT NN .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , PRP VBD DT MD VB RB RB IN PRP VBD , CC PRP VBD TO VB DT NN DT JJ NN RBR .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN NN RB .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NNS IN NNS WDT VBP VBN RP DT JJ NN CC DT JJ CD IN RB , VBG NNS IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ TO DT NNS .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology . [ pos tagging ] RB , NNS WP VBP IN NN IN RB CD NN VBG IN DT NN VB VBN RB IN NN .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP NNS VBN NN VBZ IN RB JJS NN .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does . [ pos tagging ] DT NN WDT VBD IN DT NN NN POS VBP CD : DT NN PRP VBD IN VBZ .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN JJ NN , VBD PRP RP , CC RB PRP VBD RP RB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ IN IN DT NNS PRP VBP IN PRP .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT RB JJ NN IN NN , PDT DT NNS IN CD NNS VBD VBN CC PRP VBD RB IN DT JJ NNS VBN IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP IN DT NN .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in . [ pos tagging ] PDT DT NNS VBD , DT NNS VBD : WRB PRP VBD DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ RB WP PRP VBD VBN IN .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT MD VB IN JJ NN , CC PRP MD , IN VBG DT NN IN NN IN , VBP NNS RB RB .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP VBN , DT VBZ RB NN : DT VBZ VBG IN CD CC DT JJ CD NNS IN NN .

[ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP VBN IN PRP VBP IN TO RB VB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , WRB EX VBZ JJ JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN .
why do this ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VB DT .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT VBZ RB JJ IN NNS IN DT IN DT NNS .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN TO VB IN CD CC DT NN TO CD CD NNS IN DT JJ CD NNS .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 . [ pos tagging ] TO VB PRP IN NN IN NN : NN VBD VBN IN CD .

it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBG TO VB DT NN TO VB PRP IN CD .

when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBP TO VB IN JJ NNS CC DT NN TO VB IN , PRP VBZ VBG TO VB DT JJ NN .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , EX VBZ DT WDT VBP IN DT NN WDT VBZ RP IN DT NN .

we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN RB RB IN DT JJ NN CC PRP$ NN .

and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WRB NNS VBP IN NN IN DT NN IN DT RB JJ NN .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .

they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radio . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ TO VB VBN IN IN NN , PRP MD VB DT JJ , PRP MD VB PRP$ NN , CC PRP VBP DT NN CC DT NN NN .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gras@@ ping . [ pos tagging ] JJS RB , PRP VBP JJ , IN IN DT NNS , PRP MD VB PRP RB IN VBG RP CC VBG .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information . [ pos tagging ] CC NNS VBP DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS IN VBG JJ NN .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT VBZ VBP RBR JJ , RBR JJ IN PRP$ NN , NN IN DT JJ , CC NN IN DT NN IN WRB PRP VBP PRP , PRP MD VB TO VB DT JJ CC JJ NN NNS .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ VBP VBG TO VB IN DT JJ NNS .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it roll@@ s it back@@ wards . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ VBZ VBN TO VB NN , CC IN JJ VBP PRP IN CD NN , PRP MD VB DT NN DT NN : IN NN VBP PRP DT JJ NN PRP VBZ PRP NNS .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are aware of each other . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NNS VBP JJ IN DT JJ .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ VBD PRP JJ TO DT JJ , PRP VBP JJ .
if they get surro@@ unded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP VBN , PRP VBP IN RB , PRP MD VB DT JJ JJ .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD RB VB PRP$ NN CC NN .
one of the interesting impli@@ cations on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , like po@@ uring a color the way we might po@@ ur a liquid . [ pos tagging ] CD IN DT JJ NNS IN NN , PRP VBD TO VB , VBD IN PRP MD VB JJ NNS IN NNS , IN VBG DT NN DT NN PRP MD VB DT NN .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and i can use them to po@@ ur color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN , PRP VBP VBN CD NNS VBD TO VB JJ NNS CC NN MD VB PRP TO VB NN IN DT JJ CD , WRB PRP VBP JJ .
if we over@@ sho@@ ot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP , PRP MD VB DT JJ NN RB .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP RB DT JJ NNS IN NN , IN NN , NN CC JJ NNS WRB PRP VBP TO VB NNS DT NN TO VB NNS RB , CC VBP DT NNS RB .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program . [ pos tagging ] RB RB JJ VBP : DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ VBP VBG IN DT JJ NN NN .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN NN WDT VBZ NN IN IN DT NN IN JJ CC NN .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN PRP VBP DT NN VBN NN IN DT JJ , CC IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS PRP VBZ IN DT JJ .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN IN CD NNS , PRP VBZ , CC PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN NNS CC JJ NNS TO VB .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and sho@@ ot a video . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBP DT NNS WDT VBD IN DT NN NN TO DT NNS NN , CC RB VBD TO VB PRP TO VB PRP RP , CC VBZ DT NN .
they really loved it . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBD PRP .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] CC , CD IN DT JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NN VBZ IN PRP VBP NNS VBP TO VB NNS JJ NNS .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do . [ pos tagging ] DT PRP VBP TO VB VBZ , `` VBP NNS , `` CC PRP VBP RB WP TO VB .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBZ DT JJ NNS VBG PRP RP .
that &apos;s our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP$ JJS NN NN , RB RB IN DT NN .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables up . [ pos tagging ] VBZ RP , RB PRP VBD TO VB VBD TO VB DT NNS RP .
so to him , they were just blocks . [ pos tagging ] RB TO PRP , PRP VBD RB NNS .
now , this is an inter@@ active carto@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ DT JJ NN NN .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN NN NNS .
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ JJ , RB .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB JJ NNS IN DT NN , RB IN VBG DT NNS IN DT NN WDT VBP DT NN VBN IN PRP .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBZ VBG DT NN RP .
the sun is ris@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG .
now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ ctor into the scene . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ VBD DT NN IN DT NN .
the orange tra@@ ctor . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN .
good job ! yeah ! [ pos tagging ] JJ NN . UH .
so by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of ! [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG DT NNS CC VBG PRP JJ TO DT JJ PRP MD VB DT NNS VBP : NN .
inv@@ enting his own narra@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] VBG PRP$ JJ NN .
hell@@ o ! [ pos tagging ] NN .
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBZ TO VB WRB PRP VBZ .
fly away , c@@ at . [ pos tagging ] VB RB , NN .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN NNS VBP NN TO VB PRP NN VBZ DT NN NN CC JJ NN NN IN PRP VBP VBN RB , IN WDT VBZ NN IN NNS IN NN , NN CC NNS .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use . [ pos tagging ] DT IN DT VBZ CD JJ NNS , PRP VBP TO VB WDT CD PRP VBP TO VB .
and you can inje@@ ct these sounds into a sequence that you can assem@@ ble into the pattern that you want . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB DT NNS IN DT NN IN PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBP .
and you inje@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence si@@ ft@@ able . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP PRP IN RB VBG RP DT NN JJ IN DT NN NN .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP NNS IN PRP MD VB JJ , IN NN CC NN .
you atta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP TO DT JJ NN CC RB VB TO VB PRP .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that apply to the entire sequence . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , JJ NNS IN NN CC NN WDT VBZ TO DT JJ NN .
so let &apos;s have a look . [ pos tagging ] RB NN POS VB DT NN .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN VBG DT NN IN CD NN NNS , VB PRP IN DT NN , VBP PRP , VB DT RB RBR JJ .
now i put a b@@ ass line in . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP DT NN NN IN .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ MD VB DT NN IN .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB DT NN TO DT NNS , IN JJ MD VB DT NN NN .
i can speed up the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB RP DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NN CD NN CC DT JJ .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB DT NN TO DT NN IN DT JJR NN .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it plays . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB DT NN IN PRP VBZ .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP WDT VBP TO VB PRP RP IN NN , CC NNS MD VB , VBG PRP RBR CC JJR IN NN VBP .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volu@@ me si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , RB , NN MD VB DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NN JJ , VBN TO DT NN .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP MD VB , PRP$ NN VBZ IN VBG JJ JJ NNS WDT VBP DT JJR NN TO DT NNS PRP$ NNS CC NNS VBP .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , VB VBD NN TO VB PRP CD NN IN DT JJ NN NN , CC DT JJ IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP VBG TO VB RP IN DT NN .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN VBP TO VB PRP IN VBZ IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS IN VBG IN JJ NNS WDT VBP VBG TO VB NN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NNS .
thank you very much . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP RB RB .
i look forward to talking with all of you . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP RB TO VBG IN DT IN PRP .
yes , hell@@ o . [ pos tagging ] UH , NN .
i &apos;m happy to be here . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ TO VB RB .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ? [ pos tagging ] RB , RB , WP VBZ VBG .
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB DT NN NN RB , VBG NNS IN JJ JJ NN .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ NN CC VBP VBN VBG NN IN VBG IN DT JJ NNS RB , NN VBD VBG DT IN NN RB VBD TO VB JJR JJ NN CC RB VBD TO VB WP NN MD VBN RB IN NN .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBD PRP$ JJ NNS .
so it was curi@@ osity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD NN CC VB RB VBN TO VB JJR TO DT NN , WDT VBD PRP .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like syn@@ thetic biology , etc . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP IN JJ NN IN JJ , RB RB VBG NN , NN WDT MD VB VBN IN DT , IN JJ NN , FW .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future . [ pos tagging ] VBZ IN JJ NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ NN CC MD VB RB RBR JJ IN DT NN .
there are contro@@ versi@@ al top@@ ics such as all those gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants in the fields . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP JJ NNS JJ IN DT DT RB VBN NNS IN DT NNS .
now there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the usa who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ dies@@ el fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e . [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBZ JJ NN IN DT NN WP VBZ VBG TO VB NN , NN NN VBN IN NN .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as was@@ hing po@@ w@@ der enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clo@@ th@@ es at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ tically optimis@@ ed enzy@@ mes .

and the list can go on forever . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN MD VB IN RB .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN IN PRP$ NN IN DT IN DT NN , JJ VBD VBN IN PRP RBR .
so what why ha@@ cking ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP WRB VBG .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software . [ pos tagging ] JJS IN PRP VBP JJS NNS VBP VBN IN DT IN DT NN IN NN .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on . [ pos tagging ] NN NN , CC RB IN DT NNS PRP VBZ UH , NNS VBP IN DT NN CC NN NNS CC RB IN .
that &apos;s rather sad for the ha@@ cker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN NN , IN PRP VBZ CC IN DT RB VBZ WP PRP RB WRB PRP RB DT VBD CC WP VBZ IN PRP .
software ha@@ ck@@ ers started building computers in the se@@ venti@@ es and ei@@ gh@@ ties and this gave rise to the internet . [ pos tagging ] NN NNS VBD VBG NNS IN DT NNS CC NNS CC DT VBD NN TO DT NN .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m-@@ solving in a play@@ ful , creative , original way . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN NN IN DT NN , JJ , JJ NN .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN , RB RB RB DT JJ NN , PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN , PRP MD RB RB VB DT NN NN IN VBG NNS , RB DT NN IN VBG IN DT NN , IN VBG DT NN , VBG WRB PRP MD VB NN RB CC JJR .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electr@@ on@@ ics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ ker@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circu@@ its . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD PRP VBD IN DT NN IN NN , CC PRP VBZ RB VBN IN DT NNS NN WRB PRP RB VBP DT JJ NN NN , WDT VBZ DT NNS IN JJ NNS IN JJ NNS .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic . [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB PRP VBP PRP IN NN , CC JJ MD VB TO VB DT NN IN JJ NN , NN VBZ RB DT NN NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN UH , PRP VBZ RB RB IN DT NN , IN PRP VBZ JJR JJ , IN PRP VBZ JJ , JJ VBP JJ NN , CC RB RB JJ .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB DT NN , CC PRP MD NN WDT CC RB PRP MD RB VB IN PRP , DT VBZ PRP , CC VB MD VB PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC VB RB VBN TO RB VB IN DT .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight . [ pos tagging ] DT DT NNS VBP POS RB VB NN IN CD NNS CD .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which origin@@ ally comes from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ NNS JJ NN , WDT RB VBZ IN NN , CC PRP VBZ DT NN VBN IN NN IN DT NN IN NN , CC PRP VBZ NNS CC JJ NNS DT IN DT NN IN RB .
those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing the knowledge crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .

but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ TO RB VB DT DT RB JJ NN TO PRP , TO VB IN PRP RB .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bio@@ - d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g , di@@ y bi@@ o . [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBZ JJ NN , NN NN .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ uss things online . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN DT NN , WDT VBZ JJR IN DT NN IN DT NN , WRB PRP WRB NNS MD VB CC VB NNS PRP .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN RBR IN DT JJ RB RB IN DT NN NNS IN PRP , CC RB PRP VBP JJR , UH , JJ NNS VBG VBD .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly describe . [ pos tagging ] VBN IN DT NNS , WDT VBD DT JJ NN JJ , DT NN VBD IN VBG , WDT VBP MD VB TO VB NN .
this picture on the left is of bio@@ curious , that &apos;s a ha@@ cker@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to .

children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam@@ ine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto@@ col@@ s .

for a longer time than these other two networks . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJR NN IN DT JJ CD NNS .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electr@@ onic tin@@ ker@@ ing , and com@@ bine this in a very out@@ land@@ ish way . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN CC , UH , RB JJ NN , CC VB DT IN DT RB JJ NN .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organis@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .

and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fascin@@ ation with technology . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ , RB DT VBZ DT VBP RB RB JJ NNS , CC DT JJ NN IN DT CD WDT RB VBZ NN , VBZ DT NN IN NN .
and what you can do with it and approach@@ ing society very tar@@ ge@@ ted@@ ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP MD VB IN PRP CC VBG NN RB RB CC VBG , RB , RB , WP VBP PRP VB , WP WP VBP PRP VB TO VB VBN IN , VBP PRP JJ IN VBG VBN IN DT NN .
so , okay , to ha@@ ck into biology , you need material . [ pos tagging ] RB , UH , TO VB IN NN , PRP VBP JJ .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NNS , CC PRP RB VBP NNS , CC DT VBZ DT NN .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with a doctor &apos;s degree et@@ c. only . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP MD RB VB TO VB DT NN , IN DT JJ NNS , RB JJ NNS , RB JJ NNS , IN JJ NN , VBD NNS IN DT NN POS JJ NN . RB .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN VBD TO VB , PRP , IN PRP VBP '' RB VBP TO VB DT .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB JJ IN NN , IN DT DT DT NN NN RB VBZ RBR JJ NN IN JJS JJ NNS , DT VBZ RB JJ .
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ es with this pre@@ mis@@ es , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laboratory , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with it , working like this .

i then tried to exp@@ and this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test , so dna finger@@ prin@@ ting in other words , at home again .

that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .

and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organis@@ ations , who are doing this more form@@ ally in an institu@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ ed form already .

the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting there and everything .

and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ c@@ tives , our fundamental principles ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP WDT VBP PRP$ NNS CC WDT VBP WP VBP PRP$ NNS , PRP$ JJ NNS .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu@@ ct . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD IN VBG RP DT NN IN NN IN NN .
that was really intui@@ tive , i mean , everyone expres@@ sed their wi@@ sh@@ es , their and things that move them . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD RB JJ , JJ VBP , NN VBD PRP$ NNS , PRP$ CC NNS WDT VBP PRP .
then , in my opini@@ on , a really good code was created . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP$ NN , DT RB JJ NN VBD VBN .

and then we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP RB VBD TO VB PRP RB IN DT JJ NN , CC VBP PRP VBZ '' RB RB VBN RB .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the acade@@ mic world . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP PRP IN DT NN NN VBP , IN DT NN , VBN DT NN RBR IN DT DT JJ NN .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ? [ pos tagging ] RB , WP NN IN NNS VBP PRP RB VB IN .
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical t@@ wee@@ z@@ ers .

this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .

that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has a four hundred fold magni@@ fication appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely .

you can see this at the bottom . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT IN DT NN .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD RP DT NN NN CC VBD RP DT NN DT NN CC RB VBD TO VB IN DT NN .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN NN NNP NN , CC PRP VBD DT NN IN VBG RB RB .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool . [ pos tagging ] DT NN , WDT VBD IN IN DT JJ NN IN NN , VBD NN , CC DT VBZ JJ NN .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an ee@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD CD IN DT UH , CD IN DT CD IN DT NNS WDT VBP NN NNS , DT NN CC NN IN DT , IN PRP VBD VBG IN NN , PRP$ PRP$ NN VBZ JJ RB .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBD DT DT DT NN , CC PRP VBD NN IN IN NN IN DT NN .
vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met . [ pos tagging ] NNS MD VB IN DT NN , VBP RP IN DT NN , CC VB IN DT NN .
their brain waves were then measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swi@@ t@@ ched on . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN NNS VBD RB VBN , CC VBG IN WP PRP VBD RB CC WRB PRP VBD , JJ NNS IN DT NN VBD IN .
was a very a very fan@@ cy project . [ pos tagging ] VBD DT RB DT RB JJ NN .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test thing , is the the p@@ c@@ r , the poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction , a complicated term . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN WDT RB VBD TO VB IN NN NN NN , VBZ DT DT NN , DT NN NN NN , DT JJ NN .
this is about the cop@@ ying of genes , repli@@ c@@ ating genes , dna , frag@@ ments , so that you can make them visible . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT NN IN NNS , VBG NNS , NN , NNS , IN IN PRP MD VB PRP JJ .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .

and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS WDT VBP DT VBP RB JJ , DT NNS PRP VBP RB , PRP VBP IN RB CD NN NN IN DT JJS .
and that &apos;s not within the range of ama@@ te@@ urs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB IN DT NN IN NNS , CC PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN , WDT VBZ JJ IN DT NN .
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation among many that you can use . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ RB CD NN IN JJ IN PRP MD VB .
and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and che@@ aper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware and electr@@ on@@ ics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .

i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT NN VBZ IN IN CD CD NNS CC RB .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more acc@@ essi@@ ble . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB RB PRP VBZ DT VBZ RB RB JJ , CC PRP VBZ RB IN DT NN WDT VBZ PRP RB RBR JJ .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opini@@ on . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBD DT RB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN RB VBD VBD DT NN IN DT NN NN .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which sho@@ ots about this far , two centi@@ me@@ tr@@ es or so . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ , RB , DT NN IN NN NN NN , WDT VBP IN DT RB , CD NNS CC RB .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NNS IN NN CC RB VB DT NN VBZ IN DT NN NN NN , CC RB VB NN IN NNS CC VBD PRP VBD RB CC VB IN DT .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN PRP VBP RB JJ NNP NN .
but that &apos;s my my prototyp@@ e , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electr@@ on@@ ics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ PRP$ PRP$ NN , WDT VBD RB JJ IN , IN DT NN CC IN , IN NN IN PRP , VBD DT NNS IN PRP CC JJ NN TO PRP CC DT VBD CC DT NN VBD RB JJ , CC DT NN VBD .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser and connected it to that . [ pos tagging ] RB VB VBD DT JJ NN NN CC VBD PRP TO DT .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to six@@ ty bar . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN , WRB PRP VBP PRP RP IN NN , PRP VBZ JJ NN , JJ VBP IN NN TO VB NN .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ g@@ ly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT PRP MD VB DT NNS RB RB CC RB PRP VBP DT NNS .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , whereas whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers cost about fif@@ ty euro@@ s . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN IN DT VBZ IN IN JJ CD NNS CC RB , NNS VBD NN NNS VBP IN JJ NNS .
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically do@@ able . [ pos tagging ] RB DT PRP VBZ RB IN JJ , CC PRP VBZ RB JJ .
so that &apos;s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility , so that that more people can get involved . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ RB DT DT NN NN IN DT NN , VBG DT NN RBR JJ CC VBG DT NN CC NN , IN IN DT JJR NNS MD VB VBN .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educ@@ ating themselves really well on it . [ pos tagging ] IN IN NN VBD IN DT NN , PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN CC JJS NNS VBP RB JJ IN PRP CC RB VBP DT NN IN VBG PRP RB RB IN PRP .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done . [ pos tagging ] IN IN PRP RB VB IN PRP IN JJ NN , WDT VBZ RB DT JJ IN WRB PRP VBP VBN PRP PRP CC VBP VBN PRP VBG VBN .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP NN VBZ VBG RB JJ IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
and if , as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .

and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it . [ pos tagging ] CC CC PRP VBP TO VB PRP CC VB PRP IN PRP VBP TO VB PRP CC VB PRP .
and this tra@@ des under the names open knowledge and citi@@ zen science . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS IN DT NNS JJ NN CC JJ NN .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN WRB PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NNS .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core conc@@ ern of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WDT VBZ DT NN NN IN IN NNS .

how do we humans actually function ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP PRP NNS RB NN .
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN WDT RB VBZ PRP IN DT NN , CC VBZ RB IN NN IN DT NN IN IN DT NN NN NN CC RB IN DT NN NN NN .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use inter@@ active media and can come to the most satis@@ fying result possible . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN VBZ IN WRB TO VB NNS IN JJ NNS , IN IN PRP MD VB JJ NNS CC MD VB TO DT RBS JJ NN JJ .
i think that inter@@ active media address arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were progra@@ mm@@ ed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be e@@ lic@@ ited through inter@@ active media . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP IN JJ NNS NN NN , JJ NNS IN PRP , IN JJ NNS VBN NNS WDT VBD VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN DT RB , RB JJ NN IN CC MD VB VBN IN JJ NNS .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB JJ , IN NNS RB VBP IN DT JJ NN WDT PRP VBP IN NN IN RB , IN PRP VBZ PRP IN DT NN , CC IN NN DT NN VBZ IN PRP , IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
so what are arch@@ a@@ ic models ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBP JJ NNS .
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them brie@@ fly . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBD RB CD NNS CC MD VB TO VB PRP NN .
arch@@ a@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS VBP NNS IN PRP VBD IN JJ NNS .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to these arch@@ a@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] JJ TO DT JJ NNS VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN IN NN .
that might sound unusual at first . [ pos tagging ] WDT MD VB JJ IN JJ .
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attemp@@ t to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB DT IN DT NN , RB , CC MD VB TO VB IN DT NN , IN PRP , RB , VBP VB DT JJ NN TO NN .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that since we because of these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ IN IN PRP IN IN DT JJ NNS , PRP VBP RB JJ TO VB IN DT RB , RB JJ NN , IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN .
and the third area spea@@ ks for itself really . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN NN IN PRP RB .
we all know that inter@@ active media is , by definition , non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ gation of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider lin@@ ear@@ ity normal today . [ pos tagging ] PRP DT VBP IN JJ NNS VBZ , IN NN , JJ , WDT VBZ DT NN IN NN , CC WDT IN NN NNS PRP IN PRP VBP JJ JJ NN .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN PRP VBP NN IN DT NN WRB NN VBZ VBN IN .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ? [ pos tagging ] CC WRB VBZ PRP IN IN NN , WDT VBZ RB DT RBS JJ NN IN DT NN .
i would like to prove that to you . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB DT TO PRP .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ? [ pos tagging ] WRB JJ NNS VBZ DT NN PRP VBP IN NN .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment . [ pos tagging ] PRP PRP VBP '' VB JJ TO VB DT RB , CC DT VBG MD VB CC VBZ VBG IN DT RB NN .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN WRB PRP VBP , CC VBP VBG WRB JJ NNS EX VBP .

and this this ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-@@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything . [ pos tagging ] CC DT DT NN TO VB DT JJ NN VBD NN IN NNS IN JJ NNS RB VBN , IN PRP VBP NNS VBP NN .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS VBP NNS , IN DT .

they didn &apos;t have mass media . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS VBP VBN NNS .
the only thing they had was their mind . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBD PRP$ NN .
and in this mind they had memory . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN PRP VBD NN .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN VBD VBN , CC IN DT NN IN DT JJ NNS , DT NN , NN VBD VBD VBN IN RB .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ g@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WRB PRP VBZ RB RB VBN IN PRP , DT NN TO VB IN NN .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT VBZ IN NN MD VB DT JJ NN .

the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produ@@ cer and medium . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT VBZ DT IN DT NN DT NN VBD RB DT NNS NN CC NN .

what is the media today ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT NNS NN .

they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN .

we &apos;re still extremely atta@@ ched to story@@ telling as a method of information bro@@ ker@@ age . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB RB VBN TO VBG IN DT NN IN NN NN .
the question is , what will come next ? [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ , WP MD VB RB .
we had the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP VBD DT NN NN CC PRP VBP RB VBG IN DT JJ NN NN .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fi@@ ction , i know . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB JJ CC JJ NN NN , NN VBP .
but the concep@@ ts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS IN DT NN NN , PRP VBP VBG DT DT NNS TO VB PRP$ NNS .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , about story@@ telling . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN NN , IN NN , IN NN .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more . [ pos tagging ] JJ MD VB TO VB IN DT RB RBR .
there are technical concep@@ ts such as “ aug@@ mented reality ” . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP JJ NNS JJ IN NN VBN NN NN .
so if you think of the google glas@@ ses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concep@@ ts that allows us to com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff@@ in@@ ity for virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ation , of experi@@ en@@ cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being add@@ ressed again .

another example is so-@@ called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my pres@@ entation , we are physi@@ cally moving in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual worl@@ ds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ JJ JJ NN RB JJ IN DT MD IN NN NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP RB VBG IN JJ , JJ NN RB , VBG TO DT NN IN DT NN .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ DT NN VBP DT NN , JJ NNS .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human intelli@@ g@@ ently . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP NNS WDT VBP JJ TO VB TO DT JJ RB .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space . [ pos tagging ] DT WDT VBZ IN DT NN , PRP$ JJ NN TO VB NN IN DT JJ NN NN .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s projects by michael bur@@ k , an@@ n-@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ enz , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z mü@@ ll@@ er .

i brought this project along as an example to illu@@ strate how these arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models are being add@@ ressed again . [ pos tagging ] RB VBD DT NN IN IN DT NN TO VB WRB DT NNS , JJ NNS VBP VBG VBN RB .
the whole thing is a game , i must add . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN , NN MD VB .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es for story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game . [ pos tagging ] WDT IN NN RB JJ NNS IN NN , CC PRP VBZ DT NN NN .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of person@@ s people jum@@ ping around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ so@@ le .

in any case , you imagine it happening inside . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP VBP PRP VBG RB .
this is a game for outside . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN NN .
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to en@@ able me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD RB VBN TO VB PRP TO VB DT JJ NN , TO VB DT JJ NN .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN , IN DT NN DT NN NN IN PRP VBP , IN DT JJ NN .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP NN NN VBP TO VB DT RB JJ .
you can explain this much more el@@ abor@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT RB RBR RB RBR IN , IN EX VBZ JJR RB JJR TO DT .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively on twitter . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN NN VBP DT NN IN VBG IN WDT NNS VBP VBN VBN RB CC RB IN NN .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB DT RB JJ NN IN DT NN , DT RB JJ NN , IN JJ VBP JJ CC JJ NNS IN DT NN CC , IN DT NN , VBP DT RB JJ , JJ NN IN DT RB JJ NN .
we can take a look at that now . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT RB .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explan@@ ation of what we &apos;re about to see . [ pos tagging ] NN , WP PRP MD VB RB , NN , VBZ DT JJ NN IN WP PRP VBP IN TO VB .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious . [ pos tagging ] IN NN DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NNS , DT VBZ JJ .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible . [ pos tagging ] VBG DT NN IN NN , PRP MD VB DT JJ NNS JJ .
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my pres@@ entation by stat@@ ing that the characteri@@ stics and abilities that we ac@@ qui@@ red during the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be re@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technologi@@ cal , new products .

yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers . [ pos tagging ] RB , NNS VBP CC MD VB RB JJ , CC RB VBP NNS .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT NN IN NN , IN IN NN JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN CC WRB NN IN NN NNS PRP$ NN , CC WRB PRP RB VB PRP$ NN CC NN TO VB PRP DT NN NN NN .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with bes@@ i@@ des your existence as a designer . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNS PRP VBP VBN IN NNS PRP$ NN IN DT NN .
when profess@@ ors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster . [ pos tagging ] WRB NNS VBP JJ , PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT NN NN .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ VBN TO PRP DT JJ CD NNS .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the top@@ ic natural user interface design . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN IN DT NN JJ JJ NN NN .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic prototyp@@ es of communication , interaction , etc . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP MD VB VBG PRP WRB PDT DT NNS VBP VBG TO NN PRP IN JJ JJ , JJ NNS IN NN , NN , FW .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBP MD VB RP CD IN DT JJ NNS , IN NNS VBP VBN TO VB RB JJ , RB JJ , RBR JJ RB , CC RB PRP VBP TO VB IN WP PRP NNS VBP JJ , WP PRP VBP JJ RB CC JJ .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely trans@@ formed itself from a calcul@@ ator to a digital assi@@ stant . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , IN DT NN IN JJ JJ NN NN , IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NNS CC NNS IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NNS CC NNS , NN VBD IN WRB PRP$ NNS , CC WRB DT NN VBZ RB VBN PRP IN DT NN TO DT JJ NN .
so i looked into when things are natural and intui@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD IN WRB NNS VBP JJ CC JJ .
perhaps we should take another look at this . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT .
why does this happen in the first place ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBZ DT VB IN DT JJ NN .
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed brie@@ fly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN , VBD NN RB , PRP VBP VBG IN DT JJ TO DT JJ JJ NN , CC JJ NN .
from the modern to the computer society . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ TO DT NN NN .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by one primary medium . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBN IN CD JJ NN .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ b@@ al society , charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by language . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN EX VBD DT JJ NN , VBN IN NN .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NNS VBN TO DT JJ IN PRP VBD DT JJ NN , PRP VBD JJ TO VB IN DT JJ , VB IN DT JJ NN CC DT NN RB , VB NNS CC NNS CC RB VBD DT JJ NN .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBD NN , NN RB JJ , CC RB RB .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and relatively naturally . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD NN PRP VBD TO VB , IN DT JJ NN MD RB VB , CC PRP VBP PRP RB CC RB RB .
that was then re@@ placed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstra@@ ction . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD RB VBN IN DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN IN NN .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu@@ id and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so manipu@@ late it . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN , IN IN NN PRP VBD WRB DT RB NN VBD TO VB PRP IN VBG , VBG IN NN VBD NN NN CC JJ CC VBD TO VB PRP IN NN CC RB VB PRP .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak . [ pos tagging ] VBG IN WRB CC WRB JJ VBP , DT RB JJ NN IN NN VBZ IN VBG VBN TO WRB NN VBZ PRP IN DT JJ NN , RB TO VB .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the primary medium , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT VBN NN VBD DT JJ NN , CC VBD DT NN .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN VBD , WDT VBZ WRB PRP VBP RB RB IN .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NN CC NNS .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD RB DT NN IN DT NN , WRB DT NN , NNS CC NNS VBD : VBP PRP VBN JJ , IN DT NNS VBP TO VB , PRP MD VB TO VB NN TO VB CC DT MD VB RB JJ IN NN .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP VBG IN DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN RB VBZ DT JJ CD NNS CC RB PRP VBP RB IN DT IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , DT NN IN PRP VBP VBG PRP .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP RB VBZ PRP , IN IN DT CD NN PRP VBP VBG DT JJ NNS , VBP JJ NNS , NN NN .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that clas@@ hes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the las@@ ag@@ ne and not bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not conf@@ ess to it . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN IN VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN NN : NN NNS VBP IN EX VBZ RB JJ NN IN DT NN CC RB NN CC JJ NNS , IN NN VBP TO VB DT RB CC RB VB TO PRP .
and these two worl@@ ds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment . [ pos tagging ] CC DT CD NNS , DT JJ CC DT JJ NNS IN NN , VBP VBG IN DT JJ IN DT NN .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tri@@ b@@ al society . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT VBZ IN WRB PRP VBP IN PRP , DT JJ NN , DT NN NN , PRP MD VB IN JJ NNS , NNS CC JJ NNS IN NN VBP VBN VBN IN IN DT JJ NN .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBZ RB IN DT JJ NN , CC IN DT JJ NN .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN IN NN VBZ JJ .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global theme . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN NN VBZ DT JJ NN .
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN JJ VBP RB JJ RB IN DT JJ NN CC DT NN VBZ RBR RB JJ , DT JJ NN MD RB RBR NN .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also with complete transpar@@ ency . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NNS : RB JJ IN JJ , RB JJ IN JJ , CC RB IN JJ NN .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level . [ pos tagging ] RB IN WRB NNS IN DT NN VBN TO VB WP VBZ VBG DT NN IN WP CC WRB , RB PRP VBZ VBG IN DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NN NNS IN DT JJ NN .
we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating it increasingly quick@@ er and better , for example . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN CC PRP VBP VBG PRP RB RBR CC RBR , IN NN .
just like it used to happen in the village . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBD TO VB IN DT NN .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ? [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN VBD IN WP DT VBZ , WP VBZ RB JJ TO PRP , WP VBP PRP RB VB , CC WP VBZ JJ IN PRP , IN WP NN VBZ PRP VB .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friend@@ ly , so that anybody can use it ? [ pos tagging ] IN NNS RB VBP CC VBP , MD VB PRP VB PRP RBR JJ RB , IN IN NN MD VB PRP .
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be impro@@ ved too . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP TO VB WP DT VBZ , CC RB RB VBP PRP IN IN PRP VBZ JJ , IN PRP VBZ TO VB VBN RB .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use . [ pos tagging ] CC TO VB WRB NN VBZ JJ IN NN CC WRB JJ , IN DT NN , MD VB NN IN DT CC NN NNS IN JJ DT NN IN PRP VBP DT NN RB , RB RB JJ IN JJ , IN RB DT NNS VBP JJ CC JJ TO VB .
so even while studying , you deal with the top@@ ic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology . [ pos tagging ] RB RB IN VBG , PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN CC JJ NN .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN WDT VBZ NN WRB PRP VBP CC VBP CC VBP , UH , VB PRP VB IN DT JJ NN .
and how does it look in there ? [ pos tagging ] CC WRB VBZ PRP VB IN RB .
and how do we function , when we look in there ? [ pos tagging ] CC WRB VBP PRP VB , WRB PRP VBP IN RB .
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ JJ NN CC WRB VB PRP$ NNS IN NN NN CC WRB VBZ JJ NN NN .
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS NNS RB VBD : PRP VBP TO VB JJR TO VB WRB PRP VBZ .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundament@@ ally . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP RB VB TO VB IN NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB NN JJ RB CC RB JJ , CC WP VBZ DT VB RB .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven offi@@ cially re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ ed senses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be ad@@ ded to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .

and to see how we process information , how do we absor@@ b information ? [ pos tagging ] CC TO VB WRB PRP VBP NN , WRB VBP PRP VB NN .
and just to say , what is information ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB TO VB , WP VBZ NN .
information is every difference that makes a difference . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ DT NN .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS VBP DT NN CC JJ NNS VBP WP PRP VBZ IN NN .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intui@@ tive or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible . [ pos tagging ] CC NNS VBP TO VB DT JJ NN , TO RB VB WRB NN VBZ NN , WRB NNS VBZ NN CC WRB , IN NN , NN NNS VBP , IN IN NN VBP WRB TO RB VB NNS IN JJ CC RB JJ IN JJ .
and of course how design affec@@ ts perception . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN WRB NN VBZ NN .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT RB , WRB NN NN NNS , RB NN MD VB PRP IN DT JJ NN , IN PRP MD VB RB IN DT NN , WRB NN MD VB VB WDT NN VBZ NN CC WDT CD VBZ JJ , CC NN MD RB VB PRP RB , IN VBG NNS .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a contain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains s@@ alt and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pp@@ er . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN RBR RB , CC IN PRP VBP IN DT NN , NN MD RB VB WDT CD VBZ NN CC WDT CD VBZ NN .
and if i say to someone , pass me the s@@ alt or the pe@@ pp@@ er , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NNS VBP TO NN , VB PRP DT NN CC DT NN , PRP MD VB TO JJ VB IN WP VBZ IN WP IN DT JJ NN .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the s@@ alt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN PRP MD RB RB VBP PRP CC RB VB PRP DT NN , IN PRP RB VBD CC VB VBN .
but our perception , how it dec@@ ei@@ ves us too . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN , WRB PRP VBZ PRP RB .
for example perception in this context . [ pos tagging ] IN NN NN IN DT NN .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ JJR IN DT JJ CD , RB IN PRP VBZ CC IN DT , PRP VBP RB RB JJ , CC RB PRP$ NN NNS , VBG IN DT NN PRP VBP NNS IN .
does anybody know what this is ? [ pos tagging ] VBZ NN VB WP DT VBZ .
come on . [ pos tagging ] VBN IN .
pattern recogni@@ tion should also work . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN MD RB VB .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glas@@ ses . [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP VBZ RBR JJ TO VB IN PRP$ NNS .
so it &apos;s a circle . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ DT NN .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ VBG TO VB CC VB DT JJ NN .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ RB VBP DT NN JJ JJ TO PRP , PRP RB RB RBR RB VB DT NN , WDT VBZ DT NN , DT NN CC , UH , PRP VBP DT NN , CC RB JJR CD NNS , CD NN , CD NN , DT .
this is called a law of design or gest@@ alt psychology , which in turn affec@@ ts our perception . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ VBN DT NN IN NN CC NN NN , WDT IN NN VBZ PRP$ NN .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS PRP VBZ JJ , PRP RB VBP PRP IN DT JJ NN , DT JJ NNS IN NN .
the law of pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN , DT NN IN IN NN , FW .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS RB RB IN JJ .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN WDT VBZ RB RB JJ VBZ VBN .
that might sound m@@ und@@ an@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it . [ pos tagging ] WDT MD VB NN IN JJ , CC PRP VBZ JJ , RB PRP VBP DT JJR NN IN PRP .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP PRP$ NNS IN DT NN CC RB PRP VBP PRP VBP IN NN TO VB .
that &apos;s wrong . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ .
first you see from back to front . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP IN RB TO NN .
because you project an assu@@ mption that you &apos;re seeing something you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise to the front , such as a circle . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP VBP VBG NN PRP VBP TO DT NN , JJ IN DT NN .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay , [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP RB VBP WP PRP VBP IN PRP RB VB PRP , RB PRP VBP DT TO DT RB IN PRP$ VBG NN , CC RB PRP VBP , UH ,
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something you want to see . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT JJ NN , PRP VBD NN PRP VBP TO VB .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WP VBZ RB , CC VBZ RB RB .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ RB TO DT NN , IN DT JJ NN POS NN DT NN CC VBZ , RB VBP DT NN CC VB JJ IN WP PRP VBP VBZ RB WP PRP VBP TO VB .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBZ RB TO DT NN CC PRP VBZ RB IN RB IN NN PRP VBZ VBZ RB VBN .

and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it . [ pos tagging ] CC , WP VBZ JJR , PRP MD RB RB VB PRP .
that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .

and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN IN VBG , NN , VBG .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an to the front . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP PRP CC VB DT NN IN JJ VBP VBG DT JJ TO DT NN .
then i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an . [ pos tagging ] RB VB VBP DT NN .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted area . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBP RB JJ NNS , WDT VBP NN RB IN DT , RB , PRP VBZ RB RB DT JJ NN , CC IN DT JJ NN .
does anyone know what three seconds are ? [ pos tagging ] VBZ NN VB WP CD NNS VBP .
a long time , yes . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN , UH .
that &apos;s our present . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP$ JJ .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB IN DT NN .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS VBP NN VBZ CD NNS , IN JJ NN IN DT JJ IN DT NN RB TO VB , RB VBZ VBP RB JJ IN VBG VBG NNS , IN DT PRP IN DT NN VBP NN VBD IN CD NNS .
he will have to process that as the present . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB TO VB IN IN DT JJ .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegan@@ t way , if i know this phenomenon . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP MD VB IN DT JJ CC , IN DT NN , NN MD VB VBG NNS IN DT NN IN NN IN DT RB JJ NN , IN VBN VBP DT NN .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five milli@@ seconds ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ JJ NNS .

another very exciting phenomenon . [ pos tagging ] DT RB JJ NN .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN PRP VBZ TO VB IN NN IN NN .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ , NN , RB PRP VBP IN , VB NN TO WRB JJ PRP VBP IN NN , IN NN MD RB VB VBN JJ IN WP MD VB .
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ NNS , RB DT RB JJ NN .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN NN PRP VBZ TO VB JJS NNS PRP VBP .
that means the first impres@@ sion comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we percei@@ ve things . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN VBZ TO PRP IN DT RB JJ NN , DT NN PRP VBP NNS .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ d@@ ingly . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN PRP VBP NNS , WP PRP VBP NN TO CC WRB PRP VBP PRP IN PRP$ NN RB TO VB , IN IN PRP MD VB PRP RB .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course . [ pos tagging ] IN NN NNS VBP MD RB VB IN DT NN IN NNS CC JJ NNS CC JJ NNS , CC RB IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN CC NN IN NN .
so how do humans deal with certain objects . [ pos tagging ] RB WRB JJ NNS VB IN JJ NNS .
on the one hand there are the practical fun@@ ctions in terms of product language , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts . [ pos tagging ] IN DT CD NN EX VBP DT JJ NNS IN NNS IN NN NN , RB JJ NNS CC JJ JJ NNS .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where i have to look . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP JJ NNS , WRB NN VBP RB WRB NN VBP TO VB .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous su@@ ms of money on such a little bag that you can har@@ dly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ? [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP RB JJ NNS : WRB VBZ NN VB JJ JJ NNS IN NN IN PDT DT JJ NN IN PRP MD RB VB NN IN , RB WRB PRP VBZ RB RB JJ .
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RBR IN DT JJ , IN DT JJ NN RB , NN PRP NNS VBP RB VBN IN .
going back to my actual top@@ ic natural user interface and the top@@ ic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course . [ pos tagging ] VBG RB TO PRP$ JJ NN JJ JJ NN CC DT NN WDT VBZ IN DT VBZ JJ IN NN .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satis@@ fying way possible . [ pos tagging ] NN RB VBZ WRB MD VB VB DT NN RB RB IN JJ CC WRB MD DT JJ NN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN DT IN JJ , JJ CC JJ NN JJ .
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WP DT NN VBZ .
how can i make something as user friend@@ ly as possible ? [ pos tagging ] WRB MD VB VB NN IN JJ RB IN JJ .
can i hand@@ le it directly or do i need a man@@ ual or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training . [ pos tagging ] MD VB VB PRP RB CC VBP NNS VB DT JJ CC DT JJ NN .
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBZ RBR JJ CC JJ RB .
making it differently or pre@@ t@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use . [ pos tagging ] VBG PRP RB CC JJR NNS MD VB PRP VBZ JJR TO VB .
that &apos;s something we have to understand . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN PRP VBP TO VB .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP IN DT IN DT NN IN DT NNS , RB PRP MD VB WRB JJ NN IN NN POS NN VBZ RBR JJ CC RB RB JJ , VBG DT NN IN JJ NNS CC DT NN , IN PRP VBZ RB DT NN RBR JJ IN JJ NN .
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an element@@ ary economic factor , an element@@ ary success factor , when apple appe@@ ared on the scene , if i wanted to make technologi@@ cal devices us@@ able for people . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN NN POS NN TO VB DT JJ JJ NN , DT JJ NN NN , WRB NN VBD IN DT NN , IN VBN VBD TO VB JJ NNS JJ IN NNS .
why ? [ pos tagging ] WRB .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN , PRP MD VB PRP$ NN CD NNS RBR IN NN , IN NN , IN DT JJ NN IN NN , RB JJ NN NNS .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB IN IN DT JJ NN , IN PRP VBP NN IN JJ NN CC VB CD NNS TO VB PRP , RB PRP MD RB VB CD NN TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours . [ pos tagging ] DT RB VBZ JJ NN IN PRP MD VB RB CD NNS RBR , CC IN PRP$ NN CC WDT MD VB IN NN RB PRP MD VB IN DT CD NNS .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBP VBP TO VB VBZ IN IN PRP PRP VBZ IN NN RB DT NN IN NN , TO VB TO VB JJ NNS .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct , and it took months to understand how to hand@@ le these systems . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP RB TO DT NN IN NN , RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN NNS , WDT VBD RB JJ , CC PRP VBD NNS TO VB WRB TO VB DT NNS .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able . [ pos tagging ] RB VBD DT JJ NNS , WDT RB VBD IN DT JJ NN CC JJ NN , IN NN NNS VBP , IN PRP MD VB DT NN IN NN , DT NN , DT NN IN DT NN , TO VB DT NN JJ .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor . [ pos tagging ] RB RB JJR NNS CC NNS IN JJ NNS , CC DT NN .
that made the whole thing consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly , but of course it could still be a lot better . [ pos tagging ] IN VBD DT JJ NN RB RBR JJ JJ , CC IN NN PRP MD RB VB DT NN RBR .
the next generation of graphic user inter@@ faces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN JJ JJ NNS RB VBZ IN NN DT NN JJR .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN , JJ VBP RB RB JJR JJ RBR RB IN NN .
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT NN NN .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an app@@ lic@@ ation . [ pos tagging ] IN NN MD RB IN DT NN VBZ VBG RB JJ IN NN , CC NN VBZ VBG DT NN .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ VBP DT NN RBR IN DT JJ NN NNS , WRB NN MD VB NNS IN NN , NN , NN CC NN RB IN DT NN CC NN , RB VBZ VBP RB JJR CC JJR NN .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intui@@ tive ? [ pos tagging ] CC IN RB VBZ PRP TO DT NN IN TO IN WP NN NNS VBP RBR JJ .
if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tive ? [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP RBR JJ CC RB NNS VBP TO VB PRP$ JJ NN RB RB CC VB WP DT VBZ IN DT NN IN NN IN JJ NNS , WRB VBZ NN RB JJ .
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intui@@ tive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ IN PRP NNS , NN VBZ JJ WRB EX VBZ DT RB JJ IN JJ DT NN TO VB IN PRP .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBZ JJ NNS IN TO VB RB RB , PRP VBP TO VB NNS RB JJ IN PRP .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is . [ pos tagging ] DT JJR JJ VBP IN NN RB TO VB , DT RBR JJ PRP VBZ .
and what does that mean to a designer ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ DT VB TO DT NN .
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN WRB PRP MD VB IN PRP MD VB VBG NN NNS IN NN RB , IN NN DT NN , RB NN MD VB NN IN DT IN DT NN .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN MD VB DT JJ , JJ NN NN IN DT NN CC MD RB VB DT NN RB RBR JJ RB .
that pos@@ es the question as to what is actually the most intui@@ tive performance sche@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN TO WP VBZ RB DT RBS JJ NN NN IN PRP NNS VBP CC RB JJ VBP RB VBN PRP RB .
it &apos;s the so-@@ called o@@ sit model . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN NN .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act . [ pos tagging ] PRP DT VBP PRP , CC NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ IN NN , NN , NN , NN .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ c@@ tively in part . [ pos tagging ] DT CD IN PRP VBZ VBG DT DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBP VBG PRP RB CC , RB , RB RB CC RB RB IN NN .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it fun@@ ctions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present . [ pos tagging ] DT NN RB VBZ NN IN PRP VBP RB IN PRP$ NN POS NN CC PRP VBZ JJ , IN PRP NNS VBP IN JJ CC JJ , CC VBZ VBN IN PRP DT JJ NN , IN JJS NNS VBG IN DT NN VBZ JJ .
o@@ sit in itself is used by us fif@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ certain@@ ed that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day . [ pos tagging ] NN IN PRP VBZ VBN IN PRP VBP TO VB CD NNS VBG IN DT NN , PRP VBD VBN IN WRB PRP VBP PRP VBZ VBN JJR IN IN DT NN .
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act to an interaction system . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB DT NN NN NN , NN , NN , NN TO DT NN NN .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN JJ , JJ IN DT NN IN DT NN , CC RB JJR DT NN IN DT JJ NN , CC DT NN IN DT NN IN NN , DT NN IN NN .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the one of the des@@ k@@ top . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ IN DT JJR NN IN NN NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let ori@@ ent take shape as an over@@ view , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , in@@ form in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , trans@@ act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ opp@@ ing , etc . , [ pos tagging ] CC IN VBN RB VBP DT , IN JJ VBP JJ VB NN IN DT NN , VBP IN DT NN , NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ RP RB TO PRP , CC NN MD VB IN IN NN , CC UH , JJ VBZ NN MD VB PRP RB CC VB NN CC VBP DT NN , FW . ,
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VB MD VB DT JJ NN .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB DT VBG DT NN .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD VBG DT NN RBR .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in . [ pos tagging ] NN : NN VBP VBG IN DT NN RB TO VB , MD VB RB RP , NN IN .
i get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT JJ NN , MD VB DT CC MD VB , RB VB PRP PDT DT NNS IN NN , IN NN .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consi@@ der@@ ably more intui@@ tive and natural . [ pos tagging ] CC RB NNS VBP DT NN WDT VBZ RB RBR JJ CC JJ .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acc@@ essi@@ ble via hier@@ arch@@ ically organis@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms so to speak .

if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosp@@ hor@@ us . [ pos tagging ] IN , IN NN , PRP VBP '' NN CC NN NN .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all . [ pos tagging ] RB RB , PRP PRP VBP VBG IN NN RB DT MD VB DT NN IN NN , CC JJ NNS IN DT .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem . [ pos tagging ] IN NN POS VBG IN NN , CC NN VBZ VBG IN DT NN NN .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ RB RBR JJ .

and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP PRP VBP VBG DT NN WRB PRP VBP DT RB JJR NN .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN NN , VBP DT NN , VBP DT NN NN .

it &apos;s just a little less destruction . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB DT JJ JJR NN .

that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP TO VB IN NN TO VB .

of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN NN RB IN DT .
and everything is either the pac@@ k@@ aging or the cont@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBZ CC DT NN CC DT NNS .

it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ .

here we have a the pro@@ of , by the way , that humans are not pig@@ s . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT DT NN , IN DT NN , IN NNS VBP RB NNS .
i &apos;d like to tell you why . [ pos tagging ] JJ MD VB TO VB PRP WRB .
because with pig@@ s , phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased in their soli@@ d components fa@@ e@@ ces . [ pos tagging ] IN IN NNS , NN VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NNS NNS .
with people , it is rele@@ ased in the ur@@ ine . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS , PRP VBZ VBN IN DT NN .

so humans can &apos;t be pig@@ s . [ pos tagging ] RB NNS MD VB VB NNS .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ? [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP , VBZ IN PRP .
tradition@@ ally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN DT NN IN DT NN , EX VBZ DT NN IN EX VBP RB JJ IN PRP IN DT NN .
and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP NNS DT IN PRP VBP NNS PRP$ NN , IN PRP VBP , PRP MD VB JJR IN PRP VBP '' RB IN DT , NNS VBP JJ CC JJ .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , saying : there is nothing more important than stabili@@ sing the human population . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP NN IN NN NN , CD IN PRP$ JJ NNS , VBG : EX VBZ NN RBR JJ IN VBG DT JJ NN .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NNS VBP , IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN , PRP VBP VBG DT NN .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ NN PRP VBP , DT JJR NNS PRP VBP IN IN DT NN , DT JJR .
yes . [ pos tagging ] NNS .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ? [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ , VBP RB RB RB JJ IN PRP .
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants wei@@ gh four times as much a people . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP IN NNS , DT NN IN NNS IN DT NN , RB VBZ JJ CD NNS RB RB DT NNS .

so ants wei@@ gh more than we do . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBZ JJR IN PRP VBP .

and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , has a program to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l by tw@@ ent@@ y for@@ ty , right ?

have you ever seen a climate neu@@ tra@@ l tree ? [ pos tagging ] VB PRP RB VBN DT JJ JJ NN .

just one single one ? [ pos tagging ] RB CD JJ CD .

you see ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ RB CD JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ JJ .
th@@ ank@@ fully , right ? [ pos tagging ] RB , RB .
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NNS .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the ama@@ zon forest alone . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP RB CD CD CD NNS IN DT JJ NN RB .

so all of our intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be du@@ mber than trees . [ pos tagging ] RB DT IN PRP$ NN NNS TO PRP VBG TO VB VBN IN NNS .
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c waste to be re@@ turned .

every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated . [ pos tagging ] DT NN PRP VBP IN CD NNS IN NN , WDT MD RB VB VBN .
and so there are too many of us . [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBP RB JJ IN PRP .
just because of that . [ pos tagging ] RB IN IN DT .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .

isn &apos;t that sad ? [ pos tagging ] NN POS IN NN .
and that means there are too many of us . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ EX VBP RB JJ IN PRP .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ NN TO VB JJR NN WRB PRP VBZ TO DT NN IN NN .

we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?

even if you were to sho@@ ot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBD TO VB PRP RB , PRP MD RB VB NNS .
so you can &apos;t solve that . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB VB DT .
we can do it differently . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP RB .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RB PRP$ NNS .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutri@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN PRP NN IN NN IN WDT PRP VBP RB NNS .
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT RB JJ NN TO VB RP NNS IN NN .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP IN NN IN NN , WRB PRP RB VBP DT NN VBN IN PRP .
in in china a a cham@@ ber po@@ t is still called a hon@@ ey po@@ t , you could say , right ? [ pos tagging ] IN IN NN DT DT NN NN VBZ RB VBN DT NN NN , PRP MD VB , RB .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP$ JJ NN PRP VBD RB RB JJ TO VB RP PRP$ NNS .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characteri@@ zed by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN RB RB VBG , CC RB VBG NN RB TO DT NNS .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS VBD TO VB IN VBG , IN DT NNS VBD VBG IN DT NNS CC DT NNS VBD TO VB PRP$ NNS IN RB JJ NNS .
that &apos;s why all western emp@@ ires just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they im@@ plo@@ ded . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB DT JJ NNS RB VBN IN VBG IN PRP VBP JJ NN DT NN RB CC RB PRP VBD .
you see ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP .
it was different in china . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ IN NN .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD TO VB DT NN IN CD CD NNS IN NN , IN PRP VBD RB JJ TO VB DT NNS .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me@@ al until you need to use the toi@@ let . [ pos tagging ] RB NN , IN PRP VBP VBN TO VB IN NN , NNS VBP PRP TO VB IN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ JJ TO VB CC VB DT NNS IN PRP .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP VBD VBN TO VB , RB TO VB NNS .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP MD VB WRB TO VB RP NNS IN DT NN .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a farmer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .

and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over nin@@ et@@ y percent . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN NN IN DT NN VBZ RB IN IN NN NN .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NNS VBP TO VB DT NN IN DT NNS TO VB JJ PRP VBP RB JJ JJ IN JJ .
we can support them in doing good . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP IN VBG JJ .
that &apos;s high-@@ tech agriculture of course , but the pl@@ ots take care of themselves . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ NN IN NN , CC DT NNS VBP NN IN PRP .
the side product is clean water . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ JJ NN .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP VBN IN JJ DT NN IN DT NN MD VB PRP RB .
that means the rate of crime goes down . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN NN VBZ RB .
and none of these pl@@ ots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fif@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years , none of these pl@@ ots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged . [ pos tagging ] CC NN IN DT NNS , CC PRP VBP VBN IN CD JJ NN IN PRP IN DT JJ NN NNS , NN IN DT NNS VBD DT NN .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ tr@@ e of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB JJ TO RB VB DT NN IN NN NN IN PRP CC DT NN MD VB VBN IN NNS .
that doesn &apos;t happen . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ MD VB .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP VBP RB VB TO VB DT NN IN NNS IN IN PRP VBP RB JJ JJ IN JJ .
we can support them in doing good . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP IN VBG JJ .
so we must get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT NN RB .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most su@@ it@@ able pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is the one in frank@@ fur@@ t . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB JJ , VB DT RP , IN PDT DT RBS JJ NN NN VBZ DT NN IN NN .
unfortunately not the one on offen@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the frank@@ fur@@ ters a hand . [ pos tagging ] RB RB DT NN IN NN , CC RB PRP MD VB DT NNS DT NN .
because the plant in frank@@ fur@@ t would be the best at w@@ inning back phosp@@ hor@@ us . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN NN MD VB DT JJS IN VBG RP NN .
and it must go back . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB RB .
we can see that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN VBZ RB JJ .
and we can see that it can be done . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB IN PRP MD VB VBN .
in h@@ oll@@ and we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP VBP VBN VBG IN DT IN IN CD NNS RB .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosp@@ hor@@ us . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN NN TO VB RB NN .
but we need this everywhere . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT RB .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , EX VBP CD NNS WDT VBP RB JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ NN .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c , a a bunch of ama@@ te@@ urs . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN , DT DT NN IN NNS .
it consi@@ sts of tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six member countries that control for@@ ty percent of all the oil de@@ pos@@ its . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN JJ NN NNS WDT VBP JJ NN IN PDT DT NN NNS .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed by other energy sources . [ pos tagging ] CC NN MD VB JJ TO VB VBN IN JJ NN NNS .
but phosp@@ hor@@ us will not be able to be re@@ placed . [ pos tagging ] CC NN MD RB VB JJ TO VB VBN .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB DT NN VBZ RB TO TO VB WP RB VBZ DT JJ JJR JJ , CC TO VB NN RB .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB VBZ WP VBZ JJ .
so it &apos;s about effec@@ tivity , not efficiency . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ IN NN , RB NN .
in h@@ oll@@ and it &apos;s easier to understand this , because h@@ oll@@ and built the country on flo@@ wers . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP VBZ JJR TO VB DT , IN NN VBD DT NN IN NNS .

so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effec@@ tivity . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP RB VBG IN NN NN , CC NN .

to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective . [ pos tagging ] TO WP PRP VBP VBG IN DT JJ NN .

every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBZ DT NN .

you can show that you were there . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN PRP VBD RB .

now you probably think that the com@@ pos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they &apos;ve thought of . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP RB VBP IN DT NN , WRB VBG RP DT NNS , RB VBZ NN PRP VBP VBN IN .
in reality the notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ pre@@ cise . [ pos tagging ] IN NN DT NNS VBP RB JJ CC NN .
these notes are about as pre@@ cise or im@@ pre@@ cise as the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely pre@@ cise . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP IN IN NN CC NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , RB IN DT MD VB RB JJ .
because you can &apos;t smell the flo@@ wers in the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing of the wind . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB VB DT NNS IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , PRP MD VB VB DT NN IN JJ , PRP MD VB JJ CC VB DT NN IN DT NN .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must trans@@ late these im@@ pre@@ cise indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al musical language . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT NN MD VB DT JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NNS IN DT JJ , WDT VBZ TO VB DT JJ , JJ , JJ JJ NN .
today i &apos;d like to verb@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late into music , or interpre@@ t . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP MD VB TO RB VB WP VB RB VBP IN NN , CC NN .
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB PRP DT NN IN DT NN .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ fer to do it all in ger@@ man , because if i &apos;d have to trans@@ late it into english , that would be like the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB JJ VBP TO VB PRP DT IN JJ , IN IN JJ MD VB TO VB PRP IN JJ , WDT MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
the so , music fun@@ ctions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opini@@ on . [ pos tagging ] DT RB , NN NNS DT NN IN JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS VBP DT NN IN DT NNS IN DT NN .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a vi@@ o@@ lin string . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ RB JJ TO RB VB JJ TO VB NNS CC VB DT VBG NNS IN DT NN CC DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN .
those would just be the letters you learned to write . [ pos tagging ] DT MD RB VB DT NNS PRP VBD TO VB .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' VB DT NN IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP DT NN .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spo@@ ken language . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP IN RBS IN JJ NN TO VB DT NN JJ NN IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN .
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passi@@ vely or whether you can also ac@@ tively speak it , all the way to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er .

the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
once you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the com@@ position &apos;s creation . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP VBN DT NN TO VB , IN PRP VBP PRP , PRP RB VB IN DT NN IN DT NN POS NN .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expres@@ sed by the com@@ pos@@ er themselves . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS , NNS , NNS , IN DT NNS CC NNS VBD VBN IN DT NN PRP .
you study works that have been com@@ posed before or after . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN IN CC IN .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS .
the reasons for writing it . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS IN VBG PRP .

what were their life circum@@ stances , how were the society and the politics of the time ? [ pos tagging ] WDT VBD PRP$ NN NNS , WRB VBD DT NN CC DT NNS IN DT NN .
all that interests me . [ pos tagging ] DT WDT NNS PRP .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading liter@@ ature from that period . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN VBG IN NNS CC VBG NN IN DT NN .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surro@@ unding the com@@ pos@@ er as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the com@@ pos@@ er . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP RB VBP DT JJ NN IN NN VBG DT NN IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP TO PRP RB , CC RB PRP VBZ JJR CC JJR TO VB CC VB IN DT NN .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with . [ pos tagging ] DT NN RB VBZ IN DT NN PRP VBP VBG IN .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN TO VB DT NN RB VBZ PRP$ JJ NN TO VB DT NN .
as the note is anything but a pre@@ cise indi@@ cation of the desire of a com@@ pos@@ er , and is , rather , a frame@@ work , i will now u@@ tili@@ se this frame@@ work to fill it with sense and meaning .

i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RB RB JJ IN DT NN RB , IN PRP VBD RB VBN IN NN RB VBD VBG .

i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in &apos;s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD JJ WRB NN VBD NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ CC VBD DT JJ IN NN POS CD NNS , CD IN PRP$ NN NNS .

to main@@ tain the dialo@@ gue , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er . [ pos tagging ] TO VB DT NN , RB IN DT NN .

so how do you start speaking the language of music ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB VB PRP VB VBG DT NN IN NN .
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language . [ pos tagging ] IN NN VBD , PRP VBP IN RB JJ NN IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP RB VBP TO VB NNS IN NN NNS .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before you speak an a word . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RB VB TO VB IN PRP VBP DT DT NN .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS IN DT NN WDT VBP IN DT NNS .
when you then move all your fing@@ ers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP RB VB DT PRP$ NNS IN DT JJ NN CC IN DT NN DT NN PRP VBZ VBN IN DT NNS , RB VBZ VBN RP , WDT , RB , NN IN NN .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ JJ JJ IN NNS , DT NN VBZ PRP$ JJ NN TO VB , WDT VBZ RB RBR .
beginn@@ ers &apos; clas@@ ses har@@ dly talk about interpretation . [ pos tagging ] NNS POS NNS RB VBP IN NN .
well , so it says pre@@ st@@ o at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP VBZ NN IN DT JJ , IN DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
len@@ to , slow . [ pos tagging ] NN , VB .
the l@@ oud and soft sym@@ b@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a . [ pos tagging ] DT NN CC JJ NNS , NN CC NN , NN .
most people here have heard of them . [ pos tagging ] JJS NNS RB VBP VBN IN PRP .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just rema@@ ins something technical . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN PRP VBP DT NNS , PRP RB RB VBZ NN JJ .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBZ CD DT NN .
i &apos;m surprised . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN .
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very element@@ ary . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ IN NNS RB VBP NN RB JJ .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance . [ pos tagging ] WDT VBZ IN TO VB NN IN DT NN CD POS JJ JJ NN CC NN NNS TO VB RB IN NN .
which is sing@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] WDT VBZ VBG .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start sing@@ ing on its own . [ pos tagging ] DT NN WP VBZ RB VBN TO VB , IN DT NNS RB VBD PRP WRB TO , MD RB VB VBG IN PRP$ JJ .
it &apos;s like learning to speak . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN VBG TO VB .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ on@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ TO VB CD POS JJ NNS CC NN IN NN TO RB VB PRP VB IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN .
people who have never sung con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one . [ pos tagging ] NNS WP VBP RB VBN RB RB RB VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN WP PRP VBZ IN TO VB DT NN .
to form a phr@@ ase with one &apos;s own breath . [ pos tagging ] TO VB DT NN IN CD POS JJ NN .
the music instrument is an exten@@ sion of our own body . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NN .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP$ JJ NNS TO TO VB , CC PRP$ NNS CC NNS TO VB .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fing@@ ers . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NNS IN DT NN VBP DT NNS IN PRP$ NNS .
the mel@@ o@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhyth@@ m is created through dance . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBN IN WP VBZ VBG VBN CC NN VBZ VBN IN NN .
the const@@ ant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very bene@@ ficial there . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ RB .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bor@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RBR VBP TO VB NN PRP WRB PRP VBP VBN .
you no longer need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a song . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RBR VB TO VB CC VBG DT NN .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself . [ pos tagging ] DT CD POS JJ NN VBZ VBN IN PRP VBP RB VBG VBN IN NN IN NN IN PRP .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ? [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBP DT IN PRP WP MD VB , UH , CC WP VBP PRP VB IN IN PRP MD VB NN .
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ? [ pos tagging ] RB VB VBP PRP DT , MD PRP RB VBG , DT , IN PRP VBP PRP MD VB NN .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ? [ pos tagging ] CC NN , IN PRP VBP '' VB WRB TO VB .
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use these little mus@@ cles that att@@ une the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS , PRP VBZ RB RB JJ TO VB , TO VB RP IN PRP MD RB IN DT VB JJ TO VB , CC TO VB WRB TO RB VB DT JJ NNS WDT VBP DT JJ NNS .
because you can train that . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ it@@ able . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , IN PRP VBD VBN IN PRP VBP '' JJ .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ? [ pos tagging ] RB PRP$ NN VBZ , WRB RB NN VBD DT NN .
did you get a second or third opini@@ on , as people call it so ni@@ c@@ ely no@@ wa@@ days ? [ pos tagging ] VBD PRP VB DT JJ CC JJ NN , IN NNS VBP PRP RB RB NNS .
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , PRP RB VB MD VB NN CC NN VBP NN TO TO VB IN PRP .
which i would very much re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a lo@@ vely , communic@@ ative thing . [ pos tagging ] WDT NN MD RB JJ NN , IN NN VBZ DT RB , JJ NN .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind . [ pos tagging ] CC RB NN RB VBZ TO VB PRP$ NN .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date . [ pos tagging ] RB , CC DT VBZ PRP , IN DT NN , NN VBZ TO VB JJ NN .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music . [ pos tagging ] CC VB JJ NNS VBP , JJ VBP JJ VBP DT NN IN JJ NN .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB VB IN PRP VBZ JJ CC JJ .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP$ NN VBZ , CC VBP VBP JJ PRP MD VB IN PRP IN PRP CC RB .

why do i demand from my audience that they listen ac@@ tively ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP JJ NN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBP RB .

our organis@@ m has come up with an exc@@ ell@@ ent method to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappe@@ ar . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBZ VBN RP IN DT JJ NN TO VB JJ NNS IN NN RB JJ .
you can also try it with words like re@@ ven@@ ge or ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and the like . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB PRP IN NNS IN NN CC NN CC DT JJ .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acc@@ essi@@ ble to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB DT NN TO PRP NN CC VB PRP DT RB RBR JJ TO PRP , IN PRP VBP RB RB JJ IN PRP IN DT JJ NN .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ IN DT NN .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall . [ pos tagging ] CC VB JJ NN IN DT NN PRP MD VB VBN WRB NNS VBP , NN VBZ DT NN IN VBG DT NN .
and then they start pil@@ ing up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP VBG RP NNS RB PRP$ NN VBZ VBN .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT VBZ PRP IN DT NN PRP VBP '' VBP WP PRP VBZ .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something entirely different in mind . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB RB IN PRP VBZ NN RB JJ IN NN .
he &apos;s only dec@@ ei@@ ving you and not himself . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB VBG PRP CC RB PRP .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself . [ pos tagging ] DT , DT NN NN VBP VBG IN VBZ CD WRB PRP VBP VBG PRP .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self-@@ de@@ ception , up@@ right . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN TO VB DT NN , DT NN , JJ .
this is harder to check or bring down . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJR TO VB CC VB RP .
you need time . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NN .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know talks about this time . [ pos tagging ] DT NN PRP MD VB NNS IN DT NN .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once pain@@ ted a portra@@ it of a woman . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN NN RB VBD DT NN IN DT NN .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her . [ pos tagging ] DT NN RB VBD IN DT NN NN POS NN NN IN PRP .
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see . [ pos tagging ] NN POS NN , RB NN CC NN .
it will start to look more and more like you . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB TO VB JJR CC RBR IN PRP .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN CC IN PRP VBP VBG , PRP MD VB WRB JJ DT NN VBZ CC WRB JJ NN PRP VBP TO VB WP NNS VBP RB JJ IN VBG PRP .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS VBP DT VBN NN TO DT NN .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NNS PRP NN , CC RB DT NN , IN PRP MD VB VB IN PRP RB VBZ IN DT NN .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG NN PRP MD RB VB TO VB RB PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN IN NN RB CC RB .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ JJ NN NN IN PRP CC MD VB TO VB JJR CC RBR IN PRP .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ dio@@ se invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN , IN WDT PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN TO VB PRP$ NN NNS .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RP RB RB IN NN , CC RB IN NNS , NNS , IN IN NN , IN NNS .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at her@@ self in the mirror every day and said , who is the fa@@ i@@ rest of them all ? [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN WP VBD IN PRP IN DT NN DT NN CC VBD , WP VBZ DT JJS IN PRP DT .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you . [ pos tagging ] CD NN DT NN VBZ , UH , EX VBZ NN NN IN PRP .
over the h@@ ills and all that . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS CC DT DT .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VB WRB JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN IN NN , IN DT NN MD VB NN , IN DT NN IN NN .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD RB VB IN PRP MD VB VB DT NN IN EX VBZ DT RBR JJ CD RB RB .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness here . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ TO RB VB WP PRP MD VB JJ NN RB .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN RB , TO VB DT NN NN , IN WDT PRP VBP '' VB JJ TO VB IN NN .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' RB VBP JJ JJ NNS IN NN CC NNS , CC RB IN NN .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bis@@ ho@@ p of wor@@ ce@@ ster . [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the des@@ cent of man . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN DT NN IN NNS NNS , DT NN IN NNS CC DT NN IN NN .
that humans are supposed to have des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ st@@ or shared by both humans and ap@@ es . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP VBN TO VB VBN IN NNS CC DT , UH , EX VBZ IN JJS CD NN VBN IN DT NNS CC NNS .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBD NN TO PRP$ NN CC VBD , RB WP VBZ VBZ VBN VBZ RB JJ .
that the human des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ VBD IN NNS CC PRP VBP DT VBN NN .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible . [ pos tagging ] DT , DT , DT VBZ RB JJ .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBZ , PRP MD VB NNS IN VBG RP IN PRP .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP PRP VB TO VB NNS IN VBG RP NN WDT VBZ JJ .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB JJ PRP$ NNS IN DT NN .
because we want this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , des@@ cen@@ ded from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predic@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN , DT NN IN VBG JJ , VBN IN DT JJS NNS , RB IN IN JJ NN , IN NN RB JJ IN DT NN WDT VBZ RB IN DT NN CC JJ JJ NNS , DT VBZ JJ IN PRP .
so we can &apos;t bear these things . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB IN DT NNS .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB NNS IN VBG IN NNS , RB WRB PRP VBP JJ .
to show you how slowly this mechan@@ ism disappe@@ ars and to illu@@ strate the tra@@ ces it leaves , which lead to something other than this gran@@ dio@@ se image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you . [ pos tagging ] TO VB PRP WRB RB DT NN VBZ CC TO VB DT NNS PRP VBZ , WDT VBP TO NN JJ IN DT JJ NN IN NNS , RB MD VB TO NN DT NN IN PRP .
a particularly nice story , in my opini@@ on . [ pos tagging ] DT RB JJ NN , IN PRP$ NN .
my wife told me it . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBD PRP PRP .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils . [ pos tagging ] CD NN PRP VBD RB IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBZ DT NN , CC PRP VBD PRP IN CD IN PRP$ NNS .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the tenden@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ PRP DT NN , IN PRP VBZ DT NN TO VB VBN .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ? [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD PRP , IN WP VBP PRP$ NNS .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD , UH , JJ VBP IN DT NN NN .
and because i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ VBP IN DT NN NN , JJ VBP JJ IN JJ NNS .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB PRP IN PRP VBP VBG DT JJ JJ IN DT NN , NN VBZ RB RB JJ .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to replace it with the word although . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP$ NN , WRB DT NN VBZ DT NN IN TO RB VB NN , PRP MD VB TO VB PRP IN DT NN IN .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT CC RB PRP MD VB DT NN , IN JJ VBP IN DT NN NN , JJ VBP JJ IN JJ NNS .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT VBZ VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
a young la@@ d like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fir@@ es . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT , PRP VBZ RB JJ IN VBG RP NNS .
he &apos;s interested in setting fir@@ es . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ IN VBG NNS .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP DT NNS TO VB IN WRB PRP MD VB WRB TO VB DT NN .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ RB DT JJ JJS NN , WDT VBZ DT NN NN .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB PRP VBD RP .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fir@@ es and are happy when the fire fl@@ ar@@ es up . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBP '' VB PRP$ NN IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS CC VBP JJ WRB DT NN VBZ RP .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the dan@@ ger that others create when they set a fire . [ pos tagging ] DT , PRP RB VBZ DT NN RBR WRB PRP VBP IN PRP VBP JJ IN VBG DT NN IN NNS VBP WRB PRP VBD DT NN .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out l@@ oud . [ pos tagging ] DT DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN VBD , RB IN , IN PRP$ NN VBZ RB IN DT NN , CC IN PRP MD VB VB IN RP NN .
here you have the cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which swi@@ t@@ ches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN IN DT JJ CC DT JJ , WDT VBZ IN RB IN PRP MD VB NN IN PRP , CC WDT VBZ NNS PRP VBP VB RB JJ IN JJ DT NN IN PRP MD VB DT NN JJR IN PRP CC NNS .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN JJ NNS VBP IN VBG IN PRP RB VBP RB CC RB IN DT NN IN JJ NN .
we know that something else is really true . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN NN RB VBZ RB JJ .
but we know that if we were to say that out l@@ oud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP IN IN PRP VBD TO VB IN RP JJ , JJ NNS MD VB RB VBN .
we can &apos;t just do that . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RB VB DT .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ TO VB JJ NNS IN DT NN WDT VBZ VBN TO NN .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute . [ pos tagging ] JJ MD RB VB TO VB TO PRP WP PRP VBD RP IN PRP$ NN .
according to which lo@@ gic do we dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ? [ pos tagging ] VBG TO WDT RB VBP PRP VB DT NN , DT NN , DT NN TO VB DT NN WDT VBZ JJ IN DT NN PRP VBP VBZ JJ IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illu@@ strate this . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB TO PRP CD , RB CD NNS TO VB DT .
the first example works with the pres@@ um@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN IN NN JJ IN PRP VBP CC DT IN PRP NN , CC RB RB JJ IN PRP VBP '' NN IN DT .
i &apos;m talking about the sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG IN DT NN .
what is the sou@@ l ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT NN .
the sou@@ l is something mental , lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ NN JJ , NN VBD .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB VB DT JJ , JJ NN .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or , you might say , who believe that the sou@@ l brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the sou@@ l is an in@@ corpo@@ real frame@@ work around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of fl@@ es@@ h and blood , are soli@@ d , so to speak , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBP IN NNS WP VBP RB VBN IN PRP VBP DT NN , CC , PRP MD VB , WP VBP IN DT NN VBD PRP TO NN , RB VB NN IN DT NNS : DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP , CC PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC PRP VBP RB VBN IN JJ CC NN , VBP JJ , RB TO VB , VB TO DT NN , JJ , JJ TO VB , JJ , JJ RB .
and now you see the sou@@ l as having something of a cloud like nature , an air@@ y nature , it &apos;s called anim@@ a in la@@ tin , being like a breath of air . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT NN IN VBG NN IN DT NN IN NN , DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ VBN NN IN NN , VBG IN DT NN IN NN .
and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with mind , with nature that can only live with a sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB DT NN IN NN NNS RP IN DT JJ , DT NN VBZ VBN IN NN , IN NN , IN NN WDT MD RB VB IN DT NN .
and then it can leave you . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD VB PRP .
that &apos;s how people imagine the sou@@ l works . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB NNS VBP DT NN VBZ .
that it comes to the human from outside . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ TO DT NN IN NN .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN TO VB PRP IN NN WDT MD VB JJ IN PRP$ NNS .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the lo@@ gic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP IN DT NN , RB PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBP WRB PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT NN .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three . [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP MD VB DT NN IN CD .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN CD IN NN .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a lo@@ gic to us . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN CD , WDT VBZ DT NN TO PRP .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my pres@@ entation . [ pos tagging ] DT , IN DT NN , VBZ DT RBS JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
you &apos;ll need some lo@@ gic here , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN RB , CC RB DT NN TO VB .
nam@@ ely to lie in such a way that you can simply imple@@ ment this lo@@ gic in the wrong way . [ pos tagging ] RB TO VB IN JJ DT NN IN PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
this rule of three con@@ tains three theor@@ em@@ s . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN CD NNS CD NNS .
the first theor@@ em is , kl@@ aus cla@@ ims there is no sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ , FW NNS EX VBZ DT NN .
the second theor@@ em is th@@ us , if kl@@ aus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ RB , IN VBN VBZ JJ , RB PRP VBZ NNS VBP DT NN .
now we have the third theor@@ em . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here . [ pos tagging ] RB VBD PRP RB .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to the idea of a sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN WDT MD VB RP IN NNS WP VBP DT JJ NN TO DT NN IN DT NN .
they will say , a person who has no sou@@ l is dead and can &apos;t cla@@ im anything . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB , DT NN WP VBZ DT NN VBZ JJ CC MD VB NN NN .
so you sense it already . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP PRP RB .
here this lo@@ gic is expres@@ sed in this de@@ cep@@ tive dis@@ course . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN .
you see it straight away . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP VBD RB .
the first two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ CD NNS VBP RB JJ .
i can cla@@ im anything . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB NN .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ements about reality . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ RB VB DT NNS IN NN .
i can say , the ger@@ man chan@@ cell@@ or is a man . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB , DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ VBP JJ , RB DT NN VBZ DT NN .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBP RB RB , RB DT NN VBZ RB DT NN .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ement about what is val@@ id . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ RB VB DT NN IN WP VBZ JJ .
i can cla@@ im anything . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB NN .
what is decisi@@ ve , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s val@@ id . [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ JJ , IN JJ VBP JJ , RB PRP VBZ JJ .
so when kl@@ aus says , there is no sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] RB WRB NN VBZ , EX VBZ DT NN .
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP VBZ JJ , RB PRP VBZ NNS VBP DT NN .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP RB JJ .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP$ JJ NN RB VBZ , NN MD VB NN IN DT .
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor@@ em@@ s and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor@@ em had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN TO PRP , WDT VBZ NN TO VB IN DT JJ CD NNS CC RB VBZ IN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD RB VBN VBN CC VBN NN .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the sou@@ l exists or not . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD RB VB TO VB IN DT NN VBZ CC RB .
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses the fact that two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect and atta@@ ches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , WDT RB VBZ DT NN IN CD NNS VBP RB JJ CC VBZ DT JJ CD , WDT VBZ IN PRP VBZ NN TO VB IN DT NNS , PRP MD VB PRP$ NN .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP IN IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB IN DT NN .
and we &apos;re very happy about it . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP RB JJ IN PRP .
we can apply these things to other examples . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NNS TO JJ NNS .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly an it@@ em in the daily new@@ spa@@ pers . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ IN PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN , WDT VBZ RB DT NN IN DT JJ NNS .
here you have to keep another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a philosop@@ hi@@ cal slo@@ w-@@ bur@@ ner , close to hand . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN , RB TO NN .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ te@@ ent@@ h [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ TO VB IN PRP VBG RB TO DT NN
century . [ pos tagging ] NN .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass was named after him . [ pos tagging ] EX VBD DT NN VBN JJ NN , CC NN POS NN VBD VBN IN PRP .
bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass is an ass that is made pur@@ ely of nature . [ pos tagging ] NN POS NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN RB IN NN .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ '' VBP DT NN .
it &apos;s a natural thing . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ y@@ stac@@ ks , it will star@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP PRP RB IN CD RB JJ NNS , PRP MD VB .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack it should go to first . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ NNS VBP WDT VBP PRP MD VB TO RB .
so it &apos;s right in the middle . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ JJ IN DT NN .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imag@@ ined . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB NNS IN NN VBP VBN .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ natur@@ es will can@@ c@@ el each other out . [ pos tagging ] CD RB JJ NNS IN JJ NNS MD VB DT JJ RP .
nothing will happen . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN , RB RB RB IN PRP VBP CD NN JJR IN DT JJ , RB PRP VBZ CC VBP DT NN CC NN RB .
he &apos;ll auto@@ matically go to the right thought . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB TO DT JJ NN .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determin@@ ed by the larger ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that immediately attra@@ cts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT , IN IN NN PRP VBP RB RB , VBN IN DT JJR NN WDT RB VBZ PRP , PRP MD RB RB VBP DT NN IN EX MD VB NN IN DT JJ MD .
and as we &apos;re here in frank@@ fur@@ t am main , i &apos;ll re@@ mind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP RB IN NN VBP JJ , JJ MD VB PRP IN DT NN NN IN NN NN .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar there , his name is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes people say , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no free will . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN RB , PRP$ NN VBZ JJ NN , CC RB NNS VBP , JJ NN NNS , EX VBZ DT JJ MD .
now we can come up with the second theor@@ em and say : if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP MD VB RP IN DT JJ NN CC VB : IN NN NN VBZ JJ , RB PRP VBZ DT JJ MD .
these theor@@ em@@ s are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP RB JJ CC JJ .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the pa@@ pers is what you find in this third theor@@ em . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN PRP MD RB VB RB IN DT NNS VBZ WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ ims and is th@@ us of un@@ sound mind . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NN IN DT , NN WP VBZ RB VB JJ MD MD RB VB VBN JJ JJ IN PRP$ NNS CC NNS CC VBZ RB IN JJ NN .
here you have it again . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP PRP RB .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB TO VB , RB IN DT , IN EX VBZ NN IN DT JJ MD .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first theor@@ em were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any pro@@ of . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN NN VBZ PRP TO VB IN IN DT JJ NN VBD JJ IN DT NN , RB IN NN PRP MD VB VBN DT JJ IN DT NN .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD RB , IN PRP VBP TO VB NN IN PRP CC RB IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS JJ , NN DT NN TO VB .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predic@@ tors . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP WRB PRP VBP DT NN CC RB VB , EX VBP DT NNS .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ tors , which would be prop@@ he@@ t . [ pos tagging ] CC VB JJR NN DT JJ NN IN NNS , WDT MD VB VBN .
you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little poli@@ tically in@@ cor@@ rect . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS VBP IN , IN DT MD VB DT JJ RB VBP .
say , there are no predic@@ tors . [ pos tagging ] NN , EX VBP DT NNS .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predic@@ tors , you can &apos;t prove that . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB DT VBG IN NN WP VBZ PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN IN EX VBP NNS , PRP MD VB VB DT .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB DT NN RB RB .
because while you are bus@@ y telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predic@@ tors , your counter@@ part will be very happy . [ pos tagging ] IN IN PRP VBP JJ VBG PRP IN PRP MD VB VB IN EX VBP DT NNS , PRP$ NN MD VB RB JJ .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved you . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RB JJ IN PRP VBZ VBN PRP .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD PRP RP DT NN PRP VBZ RB IN PRP .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ IN NN IN DT .

i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wit@@ n@@ essed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first . [ pos tagging ] NN MD RB VB , CC PRP VBD DT , NN VBD PRP JJ TO VB IN PRP$ NN IN JJ .

i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .

and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and they didn &apos;t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VB VBD TO VB IN DT NNS IN NN VBD TO VB JJ NNS CC PRP VBP NNS VBP VBN IN NN .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen nuclear research plant . [ pos tagging ] EX VBD DT JJ JJ NN NN .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ lich was also called a k@@ f@@ a . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT VBN NN IN DT NN , DT NN IN NN VBD RB VBD DT NN .
today they &apos;re called project ex@@ ecu@@ ting organizations . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP VBP VBN NN VBG NNS .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN CC JJ JJ NNS CC JJ NNS .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ dul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred watt per square me@@ tr@@ e , that was a to@@ y . [ pos tagging ] CC NN JJ IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN IN NN IN CD CD NN IN NN NN , WDT VBD DT NN .
and in ber@@ lin there was this crazy engineering collective . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN EX VBD DT JJ NN NN .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ TO DT NN IN JJ NN IN PRP VBD IN NN RB , IN IN DT NN VBD RB NN VBD VBN TO VB DT NN , IN NN NN VBD JJ .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ CC IN DT IN DT NNS .
at that time , there were self-@@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in kreu@@ z@@ berg in mehr@@ ing@@ h@@ of , where people thought evil took place . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , EX VBD JJ NNS CC CD IN PRP VBD IN NN IN NN , WRB NNS VBD JJ VBD NN .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was was called wus@@ el@@ tr@@ oni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBD VBD VBN NN CC PRP VBD NN CC JJ NN CC DT VBZ WRB NN VBD RP IN DT NNS .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice stat@@ ements were made , which i also was part of . [ pos tagging ] CC UH , DT NN IN WP VBZ VBD NN RB VBZ PRP , IN JJ , JJ JJ NNS VBD VBN , WDT VBP RB VBD NN IN .
i worked in the collective for el@@ even years , it was based on a gras@@ s@@ roots democracy . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN DT NN IN JJ NNS , PRP VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN .
we were a group of tw@@ ent@@ y people . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN JJ NNS .
if one person said no , there was the ve@@ to principle , which was totally de@@ moral@@ is@@ ing , for ten years , i i had gra@@ ve dou@@ b@@ ts as to whether i was perhaps really wa@@ sting my great engineering degree on something ridi@@ cul@@ ous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .

he &apos;s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBG PRP$ NN IN NN .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutsch@@ mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni@@ form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .

and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .

a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would de@@ dic@@ ate ourselves to the next top@@ ic of the future , which , in my opini@@ on , and in our opini@@ on , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .

i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introdu@@ ce to you . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN IN DT NN JJ MD VB TO VB TO PRP .
the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , how to reach one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN VBD , WRB TO VB CD CD NN JJ NNS .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD VBG IN DT RB JJ CC JJ NN WRB PRP MD VB DT NN RB NN .
on this island , that &apos;s the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on a@@ z@@ or@@ es . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , WDT VBZ DT NN NN IN NNS .
yes , here is the data . [ pos tagging ] NNS , RB VBZ DT NN .
four and a half thousand people live there . [ pos tagging ] CD CC DT JJ CD NNS VBP RB .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent at the moment . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN IN JJ NN IN DT NN .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ? [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ , WRB VBP IN PRP VBP JJR .
because technologi@@ cally it &apos;s just not possible . [ pos tagging ] IN RB PRP VBZ RB RB JJ .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP JJR JJ NN CC VB NN RB , DT NN MD VB TO VB .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WP JJ RB VBP DT NNS , WRB PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN IN NN .
they then also say , why ? [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RB VBP , WRB .
we have tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN IN NN .
that can &apos;t be a problem . [ pos tagging ] WDT MD VB VB DT NN .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physi@@ cally , the european one . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB JJ , PRP VBP CD NN IN NN CC PRP$ NN VBZ , IN PRP VBP IN PRP RB , DT JJ NN .
if we had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD VBN NN IN NN , PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NNS DT NNS IN DT NN VBP .
the question is just , calcu@@ late that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ RB , VBP DT VBD IN CD NN CC CD , DT JJ NN VBN IN DT NN , RB RB NN DT RP .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es . [ pos tagging ] WRB JJ MD DT NN IN DT RB VBP TO VB TO VB TO VB , NN , NN , NN , RB RB JJ NN JJ NNS .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide . [ pos tagging ] CC UH , JJ MD VB IN DT NN .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT DT IN DT NN .
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electrical out@@ put on dies@@ el fuel basis is ad@@ ded in the world per year . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , IN CD VBD JJ JJ NN IN NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN NN .
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ TO DT NN IN CD CD JJ NN NNS , IN PRP VBZ VBN RB RB .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is re@@ lie@@ ved with dies@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a licen@@ se for it . [ pos tagging ] DT NN POS NN IN NN IN PRP VBP VBG VBZ VBN IN NN NN , IN PRP VBP '' VBP DT NN IN PRP .
it goes fast . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB .
you put a box like this over there . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN DT IN RB .
and that generally looks like this . [ pos tagging ] CC DT RB VBZ IN DT .
in it , there are always three dies@@ els running , two are always main@@ tain@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP , EX VBP RB CD NNS VBG , CD VBP RB VBN .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load . [ pos tagging ] UH , DT VBZ WP DT WP PRP VBP IN DT NN VBZ DT NN .
we were given very accu@@ rate data . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN RB JJ NNS .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quanti@@ ties . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN NN NN CC DT JJ NN NN CC VB PRP VBZ VBZ RB DT JJ NN , CC DT NN WDT MD RB VB IN DT NN IN JJ NNS .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay , [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBD TO RB VB , PRP ,
the dies@@ el will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part . [ pos tagging ] DT NN MD VB DT NN CC DT NN , DT NN MD VB DT NN IN JJ DT NN IN PRP MD VB DT JJR NN .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , you have to switch off dies@@ el . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP TO VB NN , JJ NN JJ NNS , PRP VBP TO VB RP NN .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es can take over the entire network . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN IN DT NN PRP VBP TO VB TO PRP IN DT JJ NNS MD VB RP DT JJ NN .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP MD RB VB IN IN PRP VBP VBG VBN RB RB .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way . [ pos tagging ] NN IN DT NN VBZ VBN IN IN DT NN .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN , IN PRP MD VB PRP$ VBG NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ? [ pos tagging ] NNS RB VB PRP , WP VBP PRP VBG IN NN PDT DT NN .
that is do@@ able . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ .
but if you want to ho@@ ok up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to constru@@ ct a network , it becomes highly complicated . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP TO VB RP JJ IN DT NN NNS CC PRP VBP VBN TO VB DT NN , PRP VBZ RB VBN .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach se@@ vent@@ y to nin@@ et@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from bat@@ ter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .

that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydro@@ gen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be . [ pos tagging ] DT MD RB VB DT NN NN WDT MD VB JJ NN , NN TO NN PRP VBP RB , DT VBZ WP PRP MD VB .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB RB VB TO VB TO DT JJ NN CC NN RB NN TO NN CC RB RB NN TO NN .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ mil@@ l electro@@ chemical battery . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBD TO VB WP MD VB IN DT JJ , JJ JJ NN .
how far would you get with that ? [ pos tagging ] WRB RB MD PRP VB IN DT .
and then we tried out a whole load of simu@@ lations . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD RP DT JJ NN IN NNS .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conven@@ tional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ ent@@ y years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about fort@@ y-@@ four cents . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD NN CC NN CC DT NN , CC DT NN , DT RB JJ NN , VBD IN VBN TO DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN NN NN IN IN JJ NNS IN NN IN CD NNS , PRP MD VB IN RB JJ NNS .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD DT JJ NNS CD NNS RB .
and then we said , okay , [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD , NN ,
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ , RB PRP VBP DT NN NN .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system , if the price of dies@@ el ris@@ es by five percent a year . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJR IN DT NN NN , IN DT NN IN NN NNS IN CD NN DT NN .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the is@@ lan@@ ders . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD VBG IN DT NNS .
what needed to be done ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBD TO VB VBN .
we negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i looked for new sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN NNS , NN VBD IN JJ NNS .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the organisation . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB DT NN IN CD NNS IN DT NN , WDT MD DT MD VB DT NN .
and here you have the graphic again . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT NN RB .
the brown bit is the conven@@ tional system so to speak , the green bit is our system . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ DT JJ NN RB TO VB , DT JJ NN VBZ PRP$ NN .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ ent@@ y percent dies@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ DT NN IN NN VBZ JJ TO DT NN IN PRP RB VBP JJ NN NN NN CC DT NN IN DT NN NN NN POS NN IN TO DT JJ NNS .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which which the electric u@@ tili@@ ty on the island , said they think it &apos;s great . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN NN , WDT WDT DT JJ NN IN DT NN , VBD PRP VBP PRP VBZ JJ .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD , PRP VBP TO VB PRP , CC PRP VBP JJ VBP PRP MD VB DT JJ NN .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could pre@@ cis@@ ely re@@ constru@@ ct , so to speak , the electrical ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WRB PRP VBD TO VB DT NN IN NN , WRB PRP MD RB VB , RB TO VB , DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN TO CD NN .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP RB VBD IN DT JJS NN IN DT NN .
here it is . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ IN NN , IN DT NN IN NN .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , called ab@@ b today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the japanese . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN PRP VBD VBN IN DT NN NN , VBD NN NN , IN DT NNS , CC VBD RB VBN TO DT NNS .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ PRP MD VB IN PRP VBZ DT RB , RB JJ NN .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN NN CC MD VB RP DT NN IN CD NNS CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBD RP IN IN DT JJ NN .
and then pres@@ ented . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBD .
we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBD CD IN DT NN VBZ TO DT NN , IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ RB , IN DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN TO RB VB , RB IN DT NN PRP VBZ IN DT RB , DT NN VBZ IN PRP , RB VBZ DT JJ NN , RB VBP PDT DT NNS , IN WDT PRP VBP DT NN .
over here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission gui@@ dance system , the c@@ able &apos;s kilometer physics , to illu@@ strate the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network . [ pos tagging ] IN RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN NN , DT NN POS NN NNS , TO VB DT NN NN , RB TO VB , IN DT NN .
and here can you see the whole thing again . [ pos tagging ] CC RB MD PRP VB DT JJ NN RB .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred kil@@ o@@ watt + to the network . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB DT NN NN NN IN CD VBD NNS CD TO DT NN .
we can see it again here we can see the dies@@ el again here , and all the individual ag@@ gre@@ gates here . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP RB RB PRP MD VB DT NN RB RB , CC PDT DT JJ NNS RB .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything that could be developed electr@@ on@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBD , DT NN VBD VBN IN CD NN CC CD , CC IN NN , CD NN CC NN , PRP VBD RB NN WDT MD VB VBN RB CC IN NNS IN NN IN DT JJ NNS .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP RB JJ NNS , CC VBP PRP IN DT NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN CC DT NN IN DT NN CC NN RB IN VBZ IN DT CD .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB JJ TO VB IN DT NN IN NN , CC IN DT NN , CC DT VBZ RB VBN .
the nice thing about this top@@ ic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ IN IN DT NN , PRP MD VB VB PDT DT NNS PRP MD VB IN PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NN IN JJ NNS .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five-@@ thir@@ ty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to li@@ mit the wind and sun . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN IN TO WRB NNS MD VB VBN , DT NN NN , WRB TO VB DT IN , IN DT NN , IN NN , PRP VBP JJ NN NN NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN CC NN .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid . [ pos tagging ] IN NN DT VBZ PRP TO DT JJ NN .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot top@@ ic at the moment everywhere . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mo@@ bility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB VBG NN IN DT NN RB , CC TO VB IN IN DT NN MD VB VBN .
that means that if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN IN PRP VBP IN JJ NN JJ NNS , RB PRP VBD '' VB JJ TO VB DT IN DT NN .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN VBG CD IN DT JJ NNS , IN VBG DT NNS , UH , WDT MD RB VB VBN , CC PRP MD RB VB JJ TO VB IN DT NN RB .
and that &apos;s kind of the message . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ NN IN DT NN .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ar@@ ise . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB JJ NNS VBP CC VBP IN PRP , IN PRP MD VB WP NNS MD VB .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain amount of i@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP RP DT NN , RB PRP MD RB RB VB DT VBG NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of europe . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ JJ NN NNS RB VBZ IN VBG NNS IN JJ NN NNS , WRB DT NN RB VBZ IN DT NN IN NN .
we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN , VBP DT NN NN , CC IN PRP VBZ IN JJ CD NN CD NN , PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ JJ NNS , RB DT RB RBR NN MD VB , CC RB PRP VBZ RP RB .
that &apos;s the system . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN WDT VBZ RB JJ .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT RB RB , PRP VBZ DT NN .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ IN JJS JJ NNS TO VB DT NN JJ .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN PRP MD VB RB .
if you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP '' VBP DT VBG NN RB , RB PRP VBP TO VB PRP IN NN NNS CC NN .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milli@@ seconds . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN PRP MD VB PRP IN CC RP RB IN CD NNS .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP WP JJ NN IN NN EX VBZ RB .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN VBZ DT , PRP VBP TO VB VB IN DT VBG NNS , IN PRP RB VBP TO VB PRP$ NN IN NN , NN , JJ NN , NN , NN , JJ NN NN .
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase our mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties in the network . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ JJ NNS IN DT NN .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency . [ pos tagging ] NN RB VBZ DT NN NN VBZ VBG RB TO VB RP DT NN .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al-@@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible .

if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .

and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBP TO VB PRP CD JJ NN WDT MD VB PRP DT JJ NN IN NN .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP RB VBG DT JJ NN NNS VBP RB .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ o@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web page like this .

so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ MD VB RB , NN NN RB IN DT JJ NN .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN WRB DT VBZ JJ VBZ IN , IN NN IN RB VBG JJ NNS IN DT NN , NN MD VB IN PRP$ JJ NN NN IN DT JJ JJ NN .

here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN NN , VBZ DT NN IN PDT DT NN IN NN RB VBD .

it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ CD NN VBD JJ NNS , CC IN DT NN PRP VBZ DT JJ JJR IN DT NN IN DT NNS IN DT NNS .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se . [ pos tagging ] RB RB RB , IN DT NN , PRP VBP RB NNS IN VBG DT NN .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN NN .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN NN IN NNS .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?

if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT , RB RB IN VBG VBN IN NNS , PRP MD RB VB NN .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge . [ pos tagging ] CC , RB IN VBG RB IN NN , PRP MD VB RP NN .

so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fi@@ ction part of it . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN VBD TO VB IN DT JJ NN NN NN IN PRP .
and i was an artist . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD DT NN .
i could draw . i could paint . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB . NN MD VB .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .

i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the text@@ book . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RB VBG VBN IN NN NN VBG IN DT NN .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD : DT NN VBD TO VB PRP$ NN NN .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBD : DT NNS NN VBZ RB VBN PRP RB VBD IN DT NN IN EX VBD DT JJ NN NN RB IN NN .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely . [ pos tagging ] NN MD RB RB VB TO DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN : WDT VBD RB JJ JJ .

so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN VBD NN VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN CD .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN IN DT VBD IN NN VBD IN DT JJ NN IN NN , CD NNS IN DT JJS NN .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP POS NN IN VB PRP .

and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP CD VBP DT NN , DT JJ NN , IN DT CD NNS , IN PRP VBD TO VB .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles . [ pos tagging ] IN RB , IN DT NN CD NNS , JJ VBP VBN IN CD NNS JJ , CC CD NNS IN DT VBD IN NNS .

nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination . [ pos tagging ] NN POS NN VBZ RB JJ VBN TO PRP$ JJ NN JJ NN .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves . [ pos tagging ] NN RB , TO DT NN , VBP IN JJ NN IN WP NN VBP WRB NNS VBP DT NNS .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN NN IN DT NN VBZ JJ , CC RB RB JJ IN PRP RB VBD .
but when i cho@@ se a career as an adult , it was film@@ making . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB NN VBD DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBD VBG .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD TO VB DT JJS NN TO VB DT NN NN VBD TO VB NNS IN PRP$ NNS TO VB NNS .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD , IN DT NN , RB VBG JJ NNS , CC RB IN .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN VBD DT NN TO VB NNS CC NNS RB , CC IN VBD NN .
and of course the stories that i cho@@ se to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN DT NNS IN VBP VBP TO VB VBD JJ NN NNS : `` NN , `` `` VBZ `` CC `` DT NN . ``
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making . [ pos tagging ] CC IN `` DT NN , `` NN VBD VBG RB PRP$ NN IN NN CC VBG IN NN .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP , VBG DT CD NNS .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water cre@@ ature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g . [ pos tagging ] NN VBG VBD IN IN `` DT NN , `` WDT VBD IN TO VB DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN , WDT VBD TO VB DT NN IN JJ NN NN , PRP RB VBD NN VBN NN , NN .
and this resul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN , JJ NN WDT VBD RB IN DT NN .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN DT NN NN CD VBP DT NN : RB VBD RB , NN MD VB : NNS VBD NN NN , WDT VBZ IN DT NN , DT JJ NN , VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , PRP VBZ JJ NN POS NN IN DT RB JJ NN VBZ JJ IN NN .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBG NN JJ .
and so that got me very excited . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN VBD PRP RB VBD .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC VB NN , `` NN , DT VBZ NN WDT VBZ TO VB VBN IN DT JJ NN . ``
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN `` NN CD , `` WDT VBD PRP$ JJ NN , PRP VBD IN JJ JJR .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work . [ pos tagging ] VBG IN JJ , PRP VBD DT NN NN NN IN DT NN . DT NN NN IN DT NN IN IN DT NN MD VB .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD , CC PRP VBD RB RB , CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN : IN PRP VBD VB DT JJ JJR NN IN DT CD .

so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital do@@ main . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN VBD DT NN IN JJ NN , PRP$ JJ NN NN NN , WP VBZ DT JJ NN CC NN NN IN DT NN , CC PRP VBD VBN JJ NN .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN DT NN VBD IN PRP MD VB IN DT NN VBZ IN JJ NNS CC RB IN , CC PRP MD VB RB TO JJ NN .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBD IN CC PRP VBD PRP DT JJ NN IN DT NN .

so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .

sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality . [ pos tagging ] NNS JJ . CC DT VBZ RB TO DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBG DT NN .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port .

not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN , RB VB : IN JJ .

and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build c@@ ameras and lights and all kinds of things . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD DT NN IN NN , PRP VBD TO VB NNS CC NNS CC DT NNS IN NNS .

as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .

and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , NN RB VBD DT NN IN JJ NN .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN `` JJ , `` NN VBD , `` UH , JJ VBP VBG TO VB PRP$ NN NN IN DT NN NN NN , CC VB VBP VBG TO VB VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN . ``

we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB TO DT JJ NN .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ NNS IN PRP VBD VBN IN VBD DT JJ JJ .

i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN NN VBD RB JJ IN DT NN IN NN .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .

and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NNS IN DT NN .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBD DT RB JJ NN .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , then your consciousness is inje@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .

it was really , really quite profound . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB , RB RB NN .

i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB NN IN NN CC NN .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives . [ pos tagging ] CC DT MD VB DT NN JJ IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ RB IN NNS CC NNS , IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB CC VB TO VB DT JJS CD CD JJ JJR NNS .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet . [ pos tagging ] CC NN CC NN VBP RB JJ TO DT NNS : IN NN , RBR JJ IN TO NN RB IN DT NN .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBG JJR NNS IN JJ NNS , PRP$ NNS VBD JJ NN : EX MD VB RB JJ NN , RB RB NN , NNS MD VB IN NNS IN PRP$ JJ NN RB MD VB NN .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ TO NN , PRP VBZ TO NN , PRP VBZ TO VB .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN NNS MD VB JJ IN PRP .
also , the price of energy is very important to them . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN IN NN VBZ RB JJ TO PRP .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , IN PRP MD VB RB CD NN TO VB DT NN IN , TO VB NN , IN RB PRP MD VB NN .
now , the price of energy has come down over time . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN IN NN VBZ VBN RP IN NN .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NN VBZ VBN IN NNS IN NN .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBD DT JJ NN , CC , RB IN DT CD PRP VBP VBN DT RB JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN , CC DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP NNS , JJ , PRP MD VB JJ NNS CC VBP RB JJ NNS .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN PRP VBP PRP JJR : CC VB POS VB IN VBG PRP RB IN JJ : PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NN , CC DT NN VBZ TO VB IN NN .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ VBG DT NN , CC DT NN IN NN VBZ RB DT RB JJ CD .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .

now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN IN WRB PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN IN NN TO WP NN MD VB CC WRB DT JJ NNS VBP , EX VBZ DT NN RB , CC RB RB RB .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ RB NN IN WRB JJ DT NNS MD VB , CC PRP MD VB RB JJ .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ? [ pos tagging ] NN VBD DT JJ NNS IN DT JJ NNS : VBP PRP RB VBP TO VB RP TO VB CD .
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ? [ pos tagging ] MD VB PRP RB VBD PRP IN NN CC DT NN .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ IN IN PRP VBP IN TO CD , DT NN MD VB TO VB .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high tru@@ ck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ IN VBG `` PRP VBP DT JJ NN VBG TO VB IN DT JJ NN , CC PRP MD RB VB IN NN IN . ``
this is something that has to get to zero . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN WDT VBZ TO VB TO CD .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBD RP DT NN IN NN NN DT NN , IN CD CD NNS .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ , PRP VBZ IN CD NNS : IN NNS IN JJ NNS , PRP VBZ JJR IN CD NN .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN IN IN CD NNS IN NN IN DT NN .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero . [ pos tagging ] CC , RB , PRP VBP TO VB NNS WDT MD VB DT RB TO CD .
it &apos;s been constantly going up . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN RB VBG RP .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapi@@ dly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ JJ NNS WDT VBP RB VBN PRP IN DT , IN PRP VBP TO VB IN RB VBG TO VBG , CC VBG PDT DT NN TO CD .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .

so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero . [ pos tagging ] RB , VB POS VB IN DT CD IN DT CC VB WRB PRP MD VB DT NN TO CD .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero . [ pos tagging ] RB , CD IN DT NNS VBZ VBG TO VB TO VB RB IN TO CD .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ RB IN JJ NN NN , CC NN PRP VB DT NN .
first , we &apos;ve got population . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP VBN NN .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ CD CD NNS .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ VBN RB TO IN CD CD .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN IN JJ NNS , NN NN , VBP NN NNS , PRP MD VB IN IN , RB , CD CC CD NN , CC RB PRP VBP DT NN IN IN CD .
the second factor is the services we use . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ DT NNS PRP VBP .
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN : DT NN PRP VBP , NN , NN , NN .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP RB JJ NNS : VBG NNS IN NN NNS VBG DT NNS TO RB NN IN DT NN .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN TO VB RP .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN , RB DT JJ CD CD , PRP RB MD VB RB CC NN JJR , CC DT NN , DT NN , IN NN , VBZ VBG TO VB RP , CC RB , IN DT , WDT MD RBR IN RB DT NNS VBN IN NN .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ? [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN : VBP PRP VB VBG IN PRP$ NN TO VB JJ TO VB PRP$ NN .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN NN , DT NNS VBP CD , IN PRP VBP VBG RP CC VBG PRP$ NN NN IN DT NN NNS .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN , NN , DT NN IN DT NN , RB RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
we have something that &apos;s not going up . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NN WDT VBZ RB VBG RP .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS IN VBG NN , IN JJ NNS IN NNS , JJ NNS IN NN NNS : EX VBP DT NN IN NNS WRB PRP MD VB DT NN NNS RB VBP PRP RP IN CD NN .
there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP JJ NNS IN WRB PRP VBP JJ , CC WRB PRP VBP DT NN , WRB DT NNS IN NN VBP RB , RB RBR .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , JJ RB , IN PRP VBP JJ , PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT NN IN CD TO RB , RB , DT NN IN CD .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ CD NNS RB , PRP VBP VBN IN CD CD TO , IN RBS , RB CD CD NNS , CC DT RB VBN CD VBD PRP .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy . [ pos tagging ] RB EX POS NN IN DT JJ NN : DT VBZ VBG TO VB DT JJ CD : CC DT VBZ DT NN IN NN VBN RP IN DT NN IN NN .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN VBZ : MD PRP RB VB IN TO CD .
if you burn coal , no . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NNS , DT .
if you burn natural gas , no . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP JJ NN , DT .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN PRP VBP NN NN , IN IN DT VBG NNS CC JJ , VBZ RP NN .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , WP PRP VBP VBG TO VB TO VB IN DT JJ NN , VBZ VB DT JJ NN .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBP NN NNS .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible . [ pos tagging ] RB , WRB NN VBP DT NN `` NN , `` JJ VBP POS JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ DT NN . DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle . [ pos tagging ] DT NN CC PRP$ NNS VBP DT NN .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the creation of many mira@@ cles . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NNS RB VBP VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NNS .
usually , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP NNS VBP DT NN , WRB PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP RB NN IN NN IN , CC DT VBP IN , DT NN POS .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN WRB PRP RB VBP TO VB IN JJ NN CC VB DT NN IN DT JJ JJ NN .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ? [ pos tagging ] RB , NN VBD , `` WRB MD VB RB VB DT .
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] VBZ EX DT NN IN JJ NN , DT NN WDT MD VB NNS POS NN RB . ``
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RB TO DT NN IN WRB NN VBD NNS , CC RB NNS VBD IN .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBD PRP VBN IN DT NN IN , PRP VBP , EX VBP NNS WP VBP IN NNS .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN NN , DT NNS MD VB RP IN VBZ DT .
i decided that rele@@ asing fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN VBG NNS MD VB PRP$ NN TO DT NN RB DT NN .

i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN PRP VBP '' NN : IN NN , PRP MD RB RB VBP DT NN .

we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .

i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN RP NN , JJ , NN , NNS .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .

let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas . [ pos tagging ] NN POS VB RB IN DT VBG JJ NNS , RB VBG NN CC VBG JJ NN .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .

now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .

it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .

one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ matically less than a power plant . [ pos tagging ] CD VBZ IN DT NN IN NN VBN IN DT NNS VBZ RB JJR IN DT NN NN .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN NN , IN PRP VBP VBG IN JJ JJ NNS , NNS IN NN RBR NN IN PRP VBP IN IN DT JJ NN NN .
also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBP JJ NNS .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN POS NN DT NN , PRP VBZ JJ JJ DT NN , CC , RB , DT NN NN POS IN PDT DT NN .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , IN PRP VBP IN DT NNS , PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN VBG DT NN IN DT NN NNS IN PRP VBZ RB JJ .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .

and , finally , this stor@@ age problem . [ pos tagging ] CC , RB , DT NN NN .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .

and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , IN NN , PRP VBP DT JJ NN RB , NN WDT VBZ VBG TO VB DT NN IN CD JJR IN DT NNS PRP VBP RB .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC PRP VBZ RB DT RB JJ NN .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ RP WRB PRP VBP TO VB DT NN NN TO VB IN , VBP , CD TO CD NN IN WP PRP VBP VBG .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP VBG IN PRP IN CD NN , PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN .

is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ? [ pos tagging ] VBZ PRP DT NN NN . WP VBZ DT NN WDT MD VB PRP RB .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP NNS IN NNS VBG IN DT , NNS .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people . [ pos tagging ] IN DT IN DT CD NNS , PRP VBP IN JJS DT JJ NNS .

na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN CC NN RB VBP VBG DT NN WDT , RB RB , VBZ RB VBG DT JJ NN .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mod@@ ular , liquid . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP DT NNS IN JJ : NN , NN .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising . [ pos tagging ] CC NN RB VBD IN DT NN RB DT RB , IN DT NN IN EX VBZ DT JJ NNS VBG RB VBZ RB PDT IN NN .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBZ IN , RB IN VBG DT NN IN NN : DT CD NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ : PRP VBD , `` VB POS VB DT CD NN , DT NN . ``
it is kind of a crazy idea . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NN IN DT JJ NN .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .

and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost profi@@ le . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN PRP VBP VBG IN CD NN , PRP VBP RB VBN NN NN .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP RP DT NN , CC PRP MD RB VB IN NN PDT DT JJ NN IN NN POS NNS .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB IN VBG IN PRP , PRP RB VB DT . PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBZ RB , IN PRP VBZ NN IN IN DT NN .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP VBZ DT NN RB , RB VBN TO IN DT VBG NN NN .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS IN NN , DT RB VBZ DT NN .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN DT NN RB IN DT NN IN NN .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN , DT CD NN , WRB PRP VBP VBN RP DT NN PRP VBP RB , IN PRP VBZ VBN JJ NN .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years . [ pos tagging ] DT MD NN DT NN IN NNS IN NNS .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet . [ pos tagging ] CC , RB IN VBG NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP MD VB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP , PRP VBZ VBD NNS IN NNS RB , CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NNS CC NNS IN NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB RB .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ? [ pos tagging ] RB VB POS VB : WRB MD PRP VB PRP .
what should our report card look like ? [ pos tagging ] WP MD PRP$ NN NN VBP IN .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate . [ pos tagging ] RB , VB POS VB RB TO WRB PRP RB VB TO VB , CC RB VB IN DT NN .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction . [ pos tagging ] IN CD , PRP VBP VBN JJ NNS VBP IN DT CD NN NN .
that really is very important , that we get there . [ pos tagging ] DT RB VBZ RB JJ , IN PRP VBP RB .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement . [ pos tagging ] CC DT CD NN MD VB VBN RP IN NNS VBG IN IN JJ NNS , RB DT NN , RB PRP MD VB VBN RP NN , NN .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together . [ pos tagging ] RB , TO VB TO DT CD NN , DT JJ NNS , VBG NNS IN NN , MD VB VBN TO VB PRP$ NN NN RB .
so , the other grade is : are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ? [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN VBZ : VBP PRP VBG DT NN NN , VBP PRP VBD PRP IN PDT DT JJ NNS CC PRP VBP IN DT NN IN VBG PRP RB .
that &apos;s super important . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ JJ .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NN NN .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ? [ pos tagging ] RB , VBG RP IN RB , WP MD DT CD NN VBD NN IN .
well , again , it should have the two elements . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB , PRP MD VB DT CD NNS .
we should go through these efficiency meas@@ ures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN DT NN NNS TO VB VBG NNS : DT JJR PRP VBP , DT JJR IN NN MD VB IN NN , CC , RB , DT JJR DT NN .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NNS , DT NN PRP VBP RB , VBG NNS IN VBP MD VB PRP PDT DT NN TO DT JJ NNS , VBZ RB RB , CC RB RB RB JJR , JJ IN DT JJ , WDT VBZ DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS , PRP VBP TO VB DT IN JJ NN , CC PRP MD VB DT IN NNS IN NNS , NN NNS , JJ NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN IN DT .

there &apos;s a lot that has to come together . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ TO VB RB .
so this is a wish . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ DT JJ .
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN PRP VBP DT NN .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .

this is the one with the greatest impact . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN DT JJS NN .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .

we need to go for more research fund@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB IN JJR NN NN .

bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .

once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .

and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?

b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .

and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC RB , WRB PRP VBP DT NNS IN JJ NNS , DT NN IN VBG NN RB DT VBZ TO VB IN DT NN RB , CC DT RB JJ JJ NN : IN NN , DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ RB RB DT JJS NN , CC EX VBP NNS IN DT JJ NN WP VBP IN NN CC VB , `` UH , IN JJ MD DT JJ IN DT NN . ``
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ PRP VBZ IN JJ NN WDT MD VB PRP IN DT .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN RB VBZ IN , IN PRP MD VB PRP JJ , CC VB DT NN NNS , RB DT NNS VBP , `` UH , JJ VBP POS NN IN PRP VBZ PRP VBD RP NN , JJ NN IN JJ PRP VBD VB RP NN , CC JJ NN NN MD VB PRP IN PRP VBZ JJR IN WP VBZ VBN RB . ``
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .

b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic . [ pos tagging ] NN : RB , DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC NN : CC : JJ NN : VBP DT NN MD VB CD CD DT NN RBR IN PRP VBZ JJ RB : PRP VBZ RB DT JJ .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NNS VB RB IN JJ NNS .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste . [ pos tagging ] DT NN PRP VBP IN JJ NN IN , CC DT , JJ NNS MD VB , VBZ WRB PRP VBP NN WDT VBZ JJ CC PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT : DT , TO PRP , RB VBZ DT NN .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .

i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifest@@ yle . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , DT IN PRP RB MD VB CD NNS RB JJ IN PRP$ NN CC RB VB PRP$ NN .
the disaster is for that two billion . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ IN DT CD CD .

he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .

several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS RB RB IN VBN , NN NN VBD DT NN NN VBD DT NN NN .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , one y@@ ard of ta@@ pe , one y@@ ard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN POS JJ NN : NNS IN CD VBP TO VB DT JJS JJ NN IN IN CD NNS IN NNS , CD NN IN NN , CD NN IN NN CC DT NN .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ TO VB IN JJ .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN PRP VBZ RB JJ , PRP VBZ RB RB JJ IN PRP VBZ NNS TO VB RB RB .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , JJ VBD DT VBD DT JJ NN , CC RB VBD PRP IN DT NN NN .
and it was a huge success . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you . [ pos tagging ] CC IN RB , JJ VBP VBN IN CD NN NNS IN DT NN IN NNS CC NNS CC NNS , RB DT NN IN DT NN CD , CC EX VBZ NN IN DT NN WDT VBZ RB JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NN , CC JJ MD VB TO NN DT IN PRP IN PRP .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB , JJS NNS VBP IN VBG PRP TO DT NN .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN PRP , PRP VBP RP WP PRP VBZ VBG TO VB IN , PRP VBP IN NN .
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN NN , VBG , PRP VBP CC PRP VBD RP NNS .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sti@@ cks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBG DT NNS IN JJ NNS .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work . [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB , RB IN PRP VBP VBG IN IN NN , NN VBZ RP DT NN , CC RB PRP RB VBD PRP IN NN , CC RB PRP VBP RB , CC : JJ . : PRP VBP PRP$ NN .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse . [ pos tagging ] CC WP RB VBZ , JJS IN DT NN , VBZ IN DT `` JJ `` VBZ IN DT `` JJ , `` IN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB CC TO NN .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school . [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBP DT NN IN NNS WP VBP DT NN JJR `` JJ `` NNS IN NNS , CC IN DT JJS VBP JJ NNS IN NN NN .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , PRP VBP , PRP VBP VBN CC PRP VBP RB JJ NNS .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN EX VBP NNS WDT VBP DT NN JJR `` JJ `` NNS , CC IN DT JJS VBP JJ NNS IN NN .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ JJ NN .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all . [ pos tagging ] IN NN NNS PRP , RB RB VBP PRP VB DT JJS NNS , CC PRP VBP DT RBS JJ NNS IN PRP DT .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ? [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN PRP VBP TO VB VBZ : WRB VB . WRB . WP VBZ PRP IN PRP .
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ? [ pos tagging ] CC NN NNS TO VB IN NN IN DT NNS VBP DT NN VBG TO VB NN IN NNS , NN . NN .
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' JJ NN NN IN NN .
but there &apos;s another reason as well . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ DT NN RB RB .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ? [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ IN NN NNS VBP VBN TO VB DT JJ NN NN , RB .
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP IN PRP .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB WP VBZ VBZ , WRB PRP VBD DT NN IN DT JJ , PRP VBP IN IN NN CC WP VBZ .
it &apos;s a crisis . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN .
sound familiar ? right . [ pos tagging ] NN JJ . NN .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototyp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve prototyp@@ es , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototyp@@ es along the way . [ pos tagging ] WP NNS VBP RB VBZ IN PRP VBP IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP NNS , JJ NNS , RB VBG DT NN IN NN , IN PRP VBP JJ NNS TO VB WRB PRP VBP NNS IN DT NN .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essen@@ ce of the i@@ ter@@ ative process . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP DT NN IN NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , NNS VBP JJ NN IN WP VBZ CC WP NN POS NN .
so the capacity to play in prototyp@@ e is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams per@@ form . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN TO VB IN NN VBZ RB JJ , CC VBP PRP VB IN WRB JJ NNS VBP .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN JJS NNS VBZ IN CD NNS : NN NNS NNS , IN NN IN DT : NNS , DT JJ JJR , CC RB RB JJR IN DT , NNS , JJR IN JJS NNS .
who does the very best ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT RB JJS .
architec@@ ts and engineers , th@@ ank@@ fully . [ pos tagging ] NNS CC NNS , RB .
thir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS VBZ DT JJ NN NN VBP VBN .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB VBZ PRP . IN PRP VBP NNS CC JJ JJ NNS VBP DT NN TO VBG JJ NNS .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ , DT JJ NN RBR IN JJ , CC RB VBZ WRB PRP VBZ JJ .
if you put you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP PRP VBP DT NN NN . IN DT NN , PRP VBP RB RBR .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ . PRP VBP , PRP VBP RB , PRP VBP , `` UH , DT NN VBZ VBG TO VB . ``
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ? [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB RB . CC WRB VBZ IN .
because they have special skills of facili@@ tation . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP JJ NNS IN NN .
they manage the process , they understand the process . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN , PRP VBP DT NN .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN WP VBZ CC VBZ JJ NN TO VB MD RB VB DT NN POS NN .
speci@@ alized skills and facili@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success . [ pos tagging ] JJ NNS CC NN NNS VBP DT NN WDT VBZ TO JJ NN .
if you have 10 teams that typically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP CD NNS WDT RB VBP , PRP MD VB RB CD CC RB WDT VBP VBG NNS .
and i tried something interesting . [ pos tagging ] CC VB JJ NN NN .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD , VB POS RP DT NN , RB .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the w@@ inning team . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD DT CD NN NN IN NN TO DT VBG NN .
so what do you think happened to these design students ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBP PRP VB VBN TO DT NN NNS .
what was the result ? [ pos tagging ] WDT VBD DT NN .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ WP VBD : RB CD NN VBD DT NN NN .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize . [ pos tagging ] IN NN VBD VBN , VBP , DT CD NN NN , PRP MD VB VBN NN DT NN .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ POS IN VBG . DT JJ NNS VBP DT JJ NN .
we did the exercise again with the same students . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN RB IN DT JJ NNS .
what do you think happened then ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBP PRP VB VBD RB .
so now they understand the value of prototyp@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP VBP DT NN IN VBG .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN VBD IN VBG DT RB JJS TO VBG IN DT RB JJS .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT JJS NNS IN DT JJS NN IN NN .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success . [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBZ JJ NNS IN PRP IN DT NN IN NNS CC NN .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ? [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB : WRB MD NN RB JJ NN VBG DT NN NN .
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ , JJ VBP VB JJ NNS CC VBZ TO VB NNS VB NNS CC JJ NNS CC JJ NNS .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] CC WP DT JJ NN VBZ VBZ PRP VBZ PRP VB DT JJ NNS .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ? [ pos tagging ] IN , RB , DT NN VBZ PRP$ JJ NN , NN POS PRP .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototyp@@ e . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN TO VB DT JJ NN .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , DT VBZ DT NN IN DT NN , IN DT RB JJ NN .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com . [ pos tagging ] CC DT IN PRP WP VBP JJ MD VB TO VB TO VB .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN IN PRP MD VB IN WRB TO VB DT NNS .

there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ NN NNS WDT VBP IN DT RB RB .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN , JJ VBP , VBZ IN NN NN VBZ DT NN NN .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .

about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cin@@ es for the new yor@@ ker . a little story . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN , JJ VBD DT NN IN NNS IN DT JJ NN . DT JJ NN .

people were going crazy . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBD VBG NN .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .

we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBP '' VBP DT JJ NN TO VB IN PRP VBD TO .

the result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT VBZ VBN JJ .

it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN RB , CC PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
we can set that time machine on anything we want . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN NN IN NN PRP VBP .

for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NNS VBP VBN JJ IN DT NN NN , WDT MD VB IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN TO VB JJ IN , IN PRP VBP IN PRP IN DT NNS WDT VBP VBP , WDT VBZ , `` NN NN VBZ VBN IN JJ IN NN IN PRP VBZ NN JJ . ``
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .

something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it . [ pos tagging ] NN JJ NNS NN JJ IN IN NN POS NN IN PRP .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick . [ pos tagging ] IN NN IN PRP TO VB DT JJ , JJ VBP TO VB IN VBG PRP DT JJ , RB JJ JJ NN .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP VBG TO VB PRP WRB PRP VBZ . DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN IN DT NNS POS NN NN IN IN JJS DT CD .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP PRP IN NN NN NN IN DT CD .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB PRP IN PRP , CC RB VB MD VB PRP .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VB MD VB WRB NN VBD PRP .
so , here &apos;s what happens . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB VBZ WP VBZ .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine . [ pos tagging ] DT NN , WDT PRP MD VB : PRP$ NN , WDT PRP MD VB .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP RB VBG TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB PRP$ NN RB .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here . [ pos tagging ] CC TO VB JJ NN VBZ RP CC IN PRP$ NN NN VBP RB VBG TO VB PRP$ NN RB RB .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] DT NN PRP MD VB DT IN DT NN MD NN RB , RB RB IN NN VBP VBG RB NN MD VB RP CC IN PRP$ NN .
and the object of this is quite simple . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN DT VBZ RB JJ .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ fe . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB PRP$ NN , CC RB , IN DT VBZ RB , PRP$ NN JJ NN MD VB DT NN .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP VBZ VBN RB RB IN NN IN NN MD VB PRP , CC DT NN VBZ RB VB RP .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ RP CC IN PRP$ NN , DT NN . CC PRP MD VB NN .
ta@@ -@@ da ! [ pos tagging ] NN .
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ DT NN IN NN RB VBP TO JJ NNS WDT VBP JJ IN NN , IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN VBG DT RB : RB IN PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN RB .
probably many of you in the room know this trick . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ IN PRP IN DT NN VBP DT NN .
what happens is this . [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ VBZ DT .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a lie . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP JJ VBP VBG TO VB NN IN PRP$ NN TO VB JJ NN VBZ RP CC IN PRP$ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion . [ pos tagging ] DT NN JJ VBP VBG IN PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT VBZ RB DT NN IN DT NN .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN WRB PRP$ NN NNS IN VBG PRP TO VBG RB IN PRP , DT NN RB RB , PRP$ NN NN VBZ RB VBG TO VB IN WRB PRP VBZ , TO DT NN VBG RP IN DT .
nice one . [ pos tagging ] JJ CD .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there . [ pos tagging ] NN WP VBP NNS VBP DT NN VBZ RP RB .
so , it goes like this , from here , right . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBZ IN DT , IN RB , RB .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ VBP IN PRP$ NN NNS .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB IN WRB DT VBZ JJ , WRB PRP VBP JJ NN EX VBP RB CD NNS RB RB , IN DT NN , CC DT NN PRP VBZ NN , PRP VBZ '' NN , CD , CD , CD . PRP NNS PRP .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB RB WP DT VBZ RB . NN . CC RB VB JJ PRP$ NN RP .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ VBG RB , RB IN JJ NN , CC IN NN , PRP$ NN NN VBG RB .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WRB NN VBP PRP$ NN , JJ NN , IN JJ VBP RB , DT NN NN IN NNS DT VBG RB IN PRP$ NN .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP DT NN RB . PRP VBP DT NN RP .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . thanks . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN PRP MD VB IN PRP$ NNS CC NNS . NNS .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ? [ pos tagging ] RB , WP VBZ WDT VB TO VB IN DT NN NN .
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT NN DT NN CC RB IN DT RB VB PRP$ NN JJ JJ .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP RB DT NN CC DT NN , IN DT , TO PRP , VBD DT JJ NN .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RP IN IN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ IN NN VBN : PRP VBZ RB DT JJ JJ NN : PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP VBP DT NN IN , IN PRP VBP DT JJR NN , CC NN PRP VBZ , CC VB DT NN IN PRP , PRP VBZ RB RB RBR JJ .
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills . [ pos tagging ] RB IN CC CD IN DT NNS VBZ DT JJ : PRP VBP JJ NNS .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT NN NN .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out . [ pos tagging ] WP . DT RB VBN PRP IN .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops . [ pos tagging ] VBZ RP IN , IN DT VBZ RB RB WRB PRP VBZ .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NNS , PRP VBP RBR JJ IN NNS IN DT NN .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ JJR IN CD NN CC JJ IN DT JJ VBZ RBR IN DT JJ NN .
do@@ sage has something to do with this . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ NN TO VB IN DT .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry . [ pos tagging ] CD NN VBZ DT NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN CD NNS : JJ VBP JJ VB DT JJ RB . NN .
but the point is ... [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ :
... these do@@ sages have something to do with it . [ pos tagging ] : DT NNS VBP NN TO VB IN PRP .
and the form has something to do with it . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ NN TO VB IN PRP .
and if you want the ulti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP VB TO DT NN .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inje@@ ct this into a patient ... [ pos tagging ] RB . DT NN IN DT NN : DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBP DT IN DT NN :
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ JJ DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBZ RB JJ JJR IN DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT RB , DT NN , RB JJ MD VB PRP TO PRP DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBP NNS .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT NN .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect . [ pos tagging ] CC NN IN PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN , PRP VBZ RB PRP$ NN IN VBZ PRP JJ IN PRP$ NN CC VBZ DT JJR NN .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick . [ pos tagging ] RB VBD TO VB IN NN MD VB DT NN CC VB PRP TO DT JJ NN .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real . [ pos tagging ] CC VB NN WDT VBZ RB DT JJ NN CC VB PRP VB JJ .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP IN DT NN IN WRB PRP VBP NN , PRP VBP TO DT NN .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN . PRP VBZ RB , RB JJ , CC VB VBP VBG TO RB VB PRP DT JJ NN .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fl@@ es@@ h . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB PRP$ NN . DT VBZ RB JJ POS JJ NN .

everybody talks about happiness these days . [ pos tagging ] NN NNS IN NN DT NNS .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD NN NN DT NN IN NNS IN `` JJ `` IN DT NN VBN IN DT JJ CD NNS CC PRP VBD RP IN IN CD , CC EX VBD JJ JJR .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN IN NN , IN NNS .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN NN NN .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB NNS JJR .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN IN PDT DT NN IN NN , EX VBP JJ JJ NNS IN NN IN NN PRP RB JJ TO VB JJ IN NN .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN NN MD VB RB IN DT JJ NNS .
this app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ TO VB VBG IN PRP$ JJ NN , CC PRP VBZ TO VB VBG IN NN , IN PRP VBZ RP PRP VBP RB RB VBN RP IN NN RB VBZ .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit complexity . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ IN DT NNS VBZ DT NN TO VB NN .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RP IN DT NN `` JJ `` VBZ RB RB DT JJ NN RB , IN PRP VBP PRP TO RB JJ JJ NNS .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP EX VBZ CD JJ NN TO WDT PRP MD VB PRP , CC IN CC JJ , DT VBZ NN IN PRP MD VB TO VB RP CC PRP MD VB TO VB DT RBR JJ NN IN WP NN VBZ .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN IN NN CC NN : RB , PRP VBZ IN VBG JJ IN PRP$ NN , CC VBG JJ IN PRP$ NN CC JJ IN PRP$ NN .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the notion of happiness . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBP CD RB JJ NNS , CC PRP VBP DT VBN IN DT NN IN NN .
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ VBZ DT VBG NN , CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP MD VB VB IN DT NN WDT VBZ NN IN VBG PRP$ NN .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , DT VBZ DT JJ JJ NN .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ RB DT NN IN VBG PRP RB .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ MD VB TO VB IN DT NN IN NN WP VBD DT JJ NN IN CD IN PRP$ NNS VBD DT NN , CC DT VBD DT NN : PRP VBD PRP MD VBN VBG TO DT NN , CC PRP VBD RB JJ NN CC IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN , EX VBD DT JJ VBG NN .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD , RB RB RB , PRP VBD DT JJ NN .
but it hadn &apos;t . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ POS .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBD VBN VBD DT NNS IN DT NN .
he had had the experience . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN DT NN .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN CD NNS IN JJ NN .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN NN IN PRP VBD VBN IN DT NN : DT NN VBD VBN , CC DT NN VBD DT IN PRP VBD VBN TO VB .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves . [ pos tagging ] WP DT VBZ VBG PRP , RB , VBZ IN PRP MD VB VBG IN NNS CC IN JJ NNS IN NNS IN CD NNS .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT VBG NN , WP VBZ IN DT JJ CC VBZ DT JJ , VBZ JJ IN VBG DT JJ , CC RB PRP VBZ RB DT JJ .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT VBG NN IN DT NN NNS : PRP VBP , WRB DT NN VBZ , `` VBZ PRP VB RB WRB NN NN PRP RB . ``
and then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that kee@@ ps sc@@ ore , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBZ DT VBG NN , CC DT VBG NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ NN , CC VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NN , CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN VBG DT NN , `` WRB VBP PRP VBN VBG RB . ``
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that . [ pos tagging ] CC `` WRB VBD PRP$ NN TO VB . `` CC NN IN DT .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the notion of happiness . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP CD RB JJ NNS , DT VBG NN CC DT VBG NN , CC VBG VBN IN PRP VBZ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ t@@ eller . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBG NN VBZ DT NN .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately . [ pos tagging ] CC DT RB VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS : PRP VBZ RB .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' RB VB NNS WRB PRP VBD RP TO VB NNS .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBZ PRP NNS , DT VBZ , WP PRP VBP TO VB IN PRP$ NNS VBZ DT NN .
and let me begin with one example . [ pos tagging ] CC VB PRP VB IN CD NN .
this is an old study . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP JJ NNS VBG DT JJ NN .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD CD VB IN NN . PRP VBZ RB RBR JJ DT NNS , CC PRP VBD JJ WRB DT NN VBD VBN IN DT CD .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN TO VB IN PRP$ NN DT CD NNS .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP CD NNS , DT VBP PRP$ NNS .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP VBN , `` WP IN PRP VBD JJR . ``
and it &apos;s a very easy question . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN NN VBD JJR : PRP$ NN VBD JJR , CC DT NN IN NN WDT VBD DT VBD , JJ NN VBD , CC JJR .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBZ DT NN : `` WRB RB VBD DT NNS VBP PRP VBD . ``
and here is a surprise . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBZ DT NN .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ IN NN DT VBD DT JJ JJR NN IN DT NN IN NN NN .
the stories of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS IN DT NNS VBD JJ , CC IN DT RB JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ WRB PRP VBZ .
and nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ... [ pos tagging ] CC DT IN DT NNS VBZ RB JJ CC JJ : CC CD IN PRP VBZ DT NN :
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN PRP VBZ RB JJR IN DT JJ .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN WDT VBZ JJR VBZ DT NN WRB NN VBD IN PRP$ NN IN DT RB NN : PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
how do we know that ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP PRP VB DT .
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD DT NNS IN PRP$ NN , CC RB RBR , RB , `` WRB JJ VBD DT JJ NN , IN JJ . ``
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD JJ JJR IN DT IN IN NN , IN NN .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT VBG NN CC DT VBG NN .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN NN IN DT VBG NN , RB , NN VBD DT JJ NN .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much . [ pos tagging ] RB , WP PRP MD VB IN NN DT , CC PRP RB VBD JJ NNS , CC PRP VBZ VBN VBN , CC PRP VBZ VB : PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN NN DT IN RB VBG DT NN IN IN VBG PRP RB JJ .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB DT NN TO VB , CC RB DT JJ CC RB JJR IN RB .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT IN DT NN IN NNS , PRP VBP VBN DT VBG NN IN NN DT JJR NN , CC PRP VBP DT VBG NN IN NN DT DT NN JJR RP , RB RB PRP VBP VBN NN DT IN DT JJR NN IN PRP$ NN .
what defin@@ es a story ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT NN .
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ JJ IN DT NNS WDT NN NNS IN PRP , CC PRP VBZ RB JJ IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP RP .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings . [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT NN VBP NNS , JJ NNS CC NNS .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP RB , RB JJ CC , IN DT NN , DT VBG VBD .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBG NN VBZ PRP$ NN RB .
it has moments of experience , one after the other . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NNS IN NN , CD IN DT JJ .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ? [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB : WP VBZ TO DT NNS .
and the answer is really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : they are lost forever . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ RB JJ : PRP VBP VBN RB .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP , JJS IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NN : CC JJ VBN , PRP VBP , DT JJ NN VBZ VBD TO VB IN CD NNS RB : IN VBZ IN , PRP VBP , IN DT NN EX VBP IN CD CD IN PRP : IN DT NN , EX VBP IN CD : JJS IN PRP VBP '' VBP DT NN .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self . [ pos tagging ] JJS IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT VBG NN .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , NN PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP MD VB , IN WP VBZ IN DT NNS IN NN VBZ PRP$ NN .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP VBG IN PRP VBP IN DT NN .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self kee@@ ps for us . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB TO VB PRP MD VB TO VB JJ , CC DT VBZ RB DT NN IN DT VBG JJ NNS IN PRP .
so we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT VBG NN CC DT VBG NN , CC PRP VBP RB RB JJ .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time . [ pos tagging ] DT JJS NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN IN NN .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN NN IN DT VBG NN , IN PRP VBP DT NN , CC DT JJ NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT JJ , RB DT JJ NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN DT JJ NN .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT NN PRP VBZ IN DT IN DT VBG NN .
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBG NN , DT JJ NN VBZ RB RBR IN DT JJ NN IN EX VBP DT JJ NNS VBN .
you have not changed the story . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VBN DT NN .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , NN VBZ RB DT JJ NN WDT VBZ DT VBG NN IN DT VBG NN : NN VBZ RB JJ NN IN DT NN .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBG NN VBZ JJR IN VB CC VB NNS .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be cho@@ sen . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB DT NN WDT VBZ NNS IN , IN PRP VBP DT NN WP VBZ VBN , VBP , CD NNS IN CD JJ NNS CC VBZ VBG WDT IN PRP TO VB , RB DT NN WDT VBZ VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ JJR JJ , CC DT VBZ DT NN WDT MD VB VBN .
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice . [ pos tagging ] DT VBG NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP MD VB IN NNS , PRP VBP IN NNS IN NNS .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN , PRP VBP JJ NN IN PRP$ NN RB IN NNS .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN IN JJ NNS .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD VB IN DT , PRP VBP , IN DT NN IN DT VBG NN , CC PRP MD VB IN DT VBG JJ NN IN VBG DT VBG NN IN NNS IN DT VBG NN NN POS NN .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP DT NN IN WRB PRP VBP IN NNS DT VBZ RB RB DT NN : WDT VBZ , PRP VBP IN NNS , TO DT RB JJ NN , IN DT NN IN PRP$ VBG NN .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT RB JJ TO VB JJ VBP .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ? [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , WRB JJ VBP PRP VB PRP$ NNS .
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ CD IN DT NNS WDT VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN DT VBG NN .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB JJ VBP IN DT , VB VBP IN DT NN PRP VBD IN NN DT JJ NNS RB , WDT VBD RB DT JJS NN NN VBP RB VBN , CC JJ NN IN PRP RB RB , JJ TO WRB JJ NN VBP IN JJ NNS .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years . [ pos tagging ] CC NN RB VBP VBN PRP$ NNS IN DT JJ NN , NN MD VB , IN IN CD NNS IN DT JJ CD NNS .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN NN VBD RB VBN DT NN IN DT CD NNS IN PRP , RB MD VB VBN DT NN .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ CD NNS , CC DT VBZ IN JJS DT NN CC DT NN .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ TO VB DT NN .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ? [ pos tagging ] RB , NN MD VB DT NN JJ , PRP VBP , IN WRB JJ NN NNS VBP IN VBG NNS , CC RB IN PRP VBP JJR IN DT , EX VBZ DT JJ NN : WRB VBP PRP VB RB JJ NN IN NN NN TO DT NN IN PRP VBD IN NNS .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP PRP TO VB IN DT JJ NN .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything . [ pos tagging ] NN IN IN PRP$ JJ NN , PRP VBP DT IN DT NN IN DT NN DT PRP$ NNS MD VB VBN , CC PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN IN PRP VBD '' VB NN .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ? [ pos tagging ] RB , MD PRP VB DT JJ NN .
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN , EX VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ CD NNS , CC PRP VBP TO VB IN WRB TO VB DT NN , CC PRP VBZ RB RB IN DT JJ , IN IN PRP VBP IN NNS IN NN , RB PRP VBP CD NN , CC IN PRP VBP IN NNS IN NNS , PRP MD VB DT NN .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves . [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP PRP VB DT NNS PRP VBP VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ PRP IN DT NN IN DT CD NNS .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT CD NNS VBP RP CD NNS IN NN .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP RB CD NNS IN NN IN PRP MD VB , CD IN NN .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ? [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB : WRB JJ VBZ DT VBG NN .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD VB : WRB JJ VBP DT NNS IN DT VBG NN POS NN .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT : NN IN NNS VBZ DT RB VBN NN .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ? [ pos tagging ] WDT VBP DT NNS WDT MD VB VBN .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN DT NN , RB PRP VBP JJ IN VBG DT RB JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT VBG NN IN NN .
if you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT VBG NN , PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB IN WRB RB DT NN VBZ .
it is about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN WRB JJ CC VBD DT NN VBZ WRB DT NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN .
very different notion . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NN .
anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way . [ pos tagging ] NN WP VBZ POS JJ DT NNS VBZ VBG TO VB RP DT NN IN NN , CC VB VBP TO DT NN IN NNS IN NN , WP VBP VBN VBG RP DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN IN RB DT NN .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN IN DT VBG NN CC DT NN IN DT VBG NN VBZ VBN VBN IN JJ NNS , CC EX VBP RB NNS TO VB DT CD RB .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ DT NN NN WRB JJR IN PDT DT CD NNS VBP VBN VBN NNS IN WP PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN CC IN PRP$ NNS , CC RB VBP VBN JJ NNS IN DT NNS .
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NNS , PRP VBP VBN TO VB IN DT NN IN DT CD NNS .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN NN VBP IN PRP VBP VBN VBZ PRP VBP RB JJ .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB WRB JJ NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN , CC IN RB VB JJR NN PRP RB IN WRB RB PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NN , CC NN NN .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 . [ pos tagging ] RB TO VB PRP DT NN IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ IN NN .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ? [ pos tagging ] WP DT VBZ VBZ IN PRP VBD NN , CC PRP VBD VBN , `` UH PRP$ NN VBZ CD NNS JJ , `` WRB RB MD PRP VB IN PRP$ NN .
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB NN IN PRP$ NN , CC EX VBZ DT NN IN NN .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self . [ pos tagging ] IN VBN VBP PRP IN NN VBD PRP$ NN CD IN DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP DT NN IN NN IN WRB JJ PRP VBP IN PRP$ VBG NN .
so the cor@@ relation is low . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN VBZ JJ .
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NN IN WP VBZ NN IN DT NN NN .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN VBZ RB JJ , NNS VBP RB JJ .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN VBZ RB VBG VBN IN NNS IN PRP VBP , VBG NN IN NNS IN PRP VBP .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP JJ NNS , CC DT VBZ JJ .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN DT CD NNS , PRP VBP VBG TO VB RP VBG RB JJ NNS .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-@@ being . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN WP NN VBP VBD RB VBZ IN PRP RB MD RB VB IN NN IN DT NN IN NN .
it is a completely different notion . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB RB , DT NN PRP MD RB VB JJ IN NN VBZ IN PRP VBP RB VB TO DT JJ NNS WRB PRP VBP IN NN , CC PRP RB VBP .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rect answer . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN WRB JJ NNS VBP IN NN , PRP VBP RB VBG TO VB TO DT JJ NN .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBP DT NN , PRP VBP NNS MD VB VBN IN NN IN , VBP , PRP VBP IN NN .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ VBZ WRB PRP VBP IN NN IN NN , PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN IN NN CC JJ NNS , CC IN NN , VBP , VBZ IN NN .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refle@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBZ RP IN NN VBZ RB RB JJ TO DT VBG NN CC PRP VBZ RB RB RB JJ TO DT JJ NN WDT VBZ WRB JJ NNS VBP .
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , IN DT JJ NN VBZ IN NN , PRP MD VB RP : DT NNS MD VB RP VBG TO VB .

we know that . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT .

maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB RB JJ NN , VBG WRB JJ JJ NNS PRP VBP TO VB IN DT JJ NN . ``
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , VBG TO PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ RB DT JJ VBZ JJ .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems . [ pos tagging ] CD CD NNS DT NN VBZ RB RB RB NN NN TO VB DT NN POS RBS JJ NNS .

this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .

and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS VBP .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN PRP VBP RB RB JJ IN NN IN PRP VBP IN NNS .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ NN POS NN RB JJ IN IN JJ , IN DT VBZ NN IN PRP .
we do achieve more in game worl@@ ds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB RBR IN NN NNS . CC NN RB RB JJ IN IN JJ TO VB NN IN NNS , VBN TO VB CC TO VB .
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .

and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ NN , WRB PRP VBP NN , WRB PRP VBP NNS , PRP RB VBP JJ NN DT NN .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB , PRP VBP JJ , PRP VBP JJ , RB VBN , VBD CC JJ .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP DT NNS WRB PRP VBP VBG NNS , PRP RB VBP JJ VBP IN NNS .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ WP NN VBD TO VB WRB NN VBD DT JJ NN .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ? [ pos tagging ] WP IN NNS VBZ PRP JJ TO VB IN PRP MD VB VB NN .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ? [ pos tagging ] WRB MD PRP VB DT NNS IN NNS CC VB PRP TO VB NN .
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving environment . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN VBD IN NNS IN NN IN NN , WDT VBZ RB DT JJ JJ NN NN .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD TO VB DT JJ NNS WDT VBP JJ NNS RB JJ IN JJ NNS .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN VBZ WRB PRP VBP RP IN CD IN DT JJ NNS , RB IN NN IN NN , EX VBP NNS CC NNS IN JJ NNS WP VBP JJ TO VB PRP IN DT JJ NN , RB RB .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB DT NN , PRP VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ RB VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN . NN .
so , you can do it . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB PRP .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP PRP DT NN IN PRP MD VB RB .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN DT NN IN WP PRP VBP JJ IN . RB , PRP VBP TO VB JJ , CC EX VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NN .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT VBG RB VBG PRP$ NNS , EX VBZ RB NN JJ CC JJ TO VB VBN .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP RB NNS IN NNS .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP , NNS IN NNS IN NNS JJ TO VB IN PRP TO VB PRP$ JJ NN .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB NN IN PRP VBP IN JJ NN WDT RB , DT NN WDT IN PRP$ NNS VBP NNS IN NNS .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing . [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBZ DT JJ NN , DT VBG NN IN WRB PRP VBP RB , CC WP PRP VBP VBG .
and then we get all this positive feedback . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT DT JJ NN .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us-@@ one strength , and pl@@ us-@@ one intelligence . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBP VBN IN VBG RP CC JJ NN , CC JJ NN .
we don &apos;t get that kind of const@@ ant feedback in real life . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN IN NN IN JJ NN IN JJ NN .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us-@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us-@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 crazy idea . [ pos tagging ] WRB NNS VBP IN DT NN NN VBP RB VBG TO VB JJ NN , CC JJ NN NN , JJ JJ NN .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS NN WDT NN IN JJ NN .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN IN JJ NN NNS IN NN IN NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB IN DT NN IN DT NN NN PDT DT NN IN PRP VBP TO VB DT PRP$ NN IN DT NN NNS .
it &apos;s just better than reality . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJR IN NN .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN RB , RB PDT DT NN IN NN NNS VBP VBN CD CD NNS VBG DT JJ NNS IN DT .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ RB RB DT JJ NN .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up . [ pos tagging ] CC TO VB DT IN NN : CD CD NNS RB VBD WRB PRP$ JJS NN JJ NNS VBD RP .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD DT JJ JJ NN .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently invest@@ ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magni@@ tude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing . [ pos tagging ] NN , RB WRB PRP VBP IN WRB JJ NN PRP VBP RB VBG IN VBG NNS , DT JJ NN PRP VBZ NN TO RB VB IN PRP VBZ TO VB IN NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ NN .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB JJ . IN PRP VBZ RP IN IN VBG PDT DT NN VBG NNS , PRP VBP RB VBG WP PRP VBP JJ IN IN JJ NNS .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT RBR JJ CC JJ NNS .
this is true . i believe this . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ . NN VBP DT .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 . [ pos tagging ] RB , VB DT RB JJ NN : PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT NN IN NN NN NN : DT JJ JJ NN NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN MD VB VBN CD NNS VBG JJ NNS IN DT NN IN CD .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons . [ pos tagging ] RB CD NNS VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN CD NNS .
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT , IN NNS IN DT JJ NNS CD NNS VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN PRP MD VB IN NN IN JJ NN TO JJ NN NN IN PRP VBP JJ NN .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBP DT JJ JJ NN IN NN VBG IN WRB JJ NNS VBP VBG IN JJ IN WP PRP VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP VBG IN NN RB IN NN .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC DT IN PRP VBP RB VBN NN NN POS JJ NN `` NNS . ``
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP MD VB NN IN PRP$ NN IN NN , DT CD NN NN IN NN .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN NN IN IN PRP MD VB CD NNS IN JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN IN CD , PRP MD VB VBN IN PRP .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RB JJ IN WDT PRP VBP IN DT JJS NNS IN DT NN .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , RB WP PRP VBP VBG IN VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS WP VBP JJ NNS .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN VBZ , `` WP RB VBP NNS VBG RB JJ IN . ``
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands . [ pos tagging ] IN IN PRP MD VB DT RP , PRP MD VB DT RB JJ JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB JJ NNS PRP RB VBP IN DT NN WP VBP IN JJS DT NN DT NN VBG JJ NNS .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP PRP$ JJ NNS , CD CD NNS WP VBP RB JJ IN NN .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT CD NNS WP VBP RB JJ IN WDT DT VBZ .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP '' VBP PRP RB , DT VBZ VBG .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBZ VBG NNS WDT VBP JJ NN CC DT NN IN DT NN NN NNS RB IN NN NN IN IN NNS DT IN DT NN , RB IN NN , NN , NN , MD VB JJ .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP CD CD JJR NNS IN DT JJ NN .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP IN TO CD CD NNS .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ VBP VBN TO VB IN WP DT NNS VBP VBG PRP NN IN .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP DT CD NNS NN VBD RP IN . DT JJ VBZ JJ NN .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation . [ pos tagging ] NN , NN IN DT IN JJ NN .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN VBZ DT NN TO VB RB TO VB DT NN , VBN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN NN .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now . [ pos tagging ] NNS RB VBP IN DT NN NN VBZ JJ , CC IN PRP VBZ RB JJ VBG , CC VBG RB .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP JJ NN RB .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP VBN IN VBG DT JJ JJ NN .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN VBG NN WDT VBZ IN PRP VBP NNS RB IN PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP , RB IN PRP VBP VBN PRP RB .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ , PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN TO VB DT NN IN NN .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN PRP MD VB PRP$ NN IN PRP , IN PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NNS , NN DT JJ NN , PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ RP .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , VBG DT NN RB RB VBZ RP NNS CC NN CC NN .
and we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBP JJR JJ NNS IN DT NN .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . i love it . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN . NN VBP PRP .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP EX VBZ DT NN WRB DT JJ NN IN NN NN NNS IN CD NNS DT NN , NN IN DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN PRP VBP , WRB PRP VBP VBG DT NN , IN PRP VBP RB JJR VBG RB IN PRP VBP VBG , CC VBG RP .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaning@@ ful work . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN PRP VBP VBN , IN JJ NNS , TO VB RB JJ NN .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work . [ pos tagging ] CC NNS VBP JJ TO VB RB PDT DT NN , IN PRP VBP VBN DT JJ NN .
finally : epi@@ c meaning . [ pos tagging ] RB : NN NN .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP TO VB VBN TO JJ NNS TO JJ JJ NNS .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB CD NN IN NN WDT VBZ VB DT IN NN : RB , PRP DT VBP NN , JJS NN IN DT NN .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki . [ pos tagging ] JJ JJS NN IN DT NN , IN RB CD NNS , VBZ DT NN IN NN NN .
five million people use it every month . [ pos tagging ] CD CD NNS VBP PRP DT NN .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN JJR NN IN NN IN NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
they are building an epi@@ c story . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG DT NN NN .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG DT NN NN NN IN DT NN IN NN .
okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals . [ pos tagging ] NN , IN DT VBP CD NNS WDT VBP RB TO CD NN : NNS VBP JJ , JJ NNS .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP NNS WP VBP IN PRP VBP RB JJ IN VBG DT NN .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ IN PRP VBP IN PRP VBP JJ IN VBG JJ NNS CC RB DT JJ NN .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN NN VBP VBG TO VB .
there &apos;s an econom@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN VBN RB NN .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBZ JJ . PRP VBZ IN WRB NNS VBP VBG RB JJ NN CC NN CC NN IN JJ NNS .

and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so , he &apos;s rational . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT NN . RB , PRP VBZ JJ .
and he says ... [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ :
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP : VB VBP DT NN NN : CC VBP JJ .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN DT VBZ JJ NN , IN NNS MD VB RBR IN NN NNS IN PRP MD IN JJ NN .
they can have stron@@ ger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB JJR JJ NNS IN NNS IN PRP MD VB IN JJ NN : PRP VBP JJR NN CC VB JJR VBN IN NNS IN PRP VBP IN JJ NN .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBZ IN RB PRP VBZ JJ NN IN NNS TO VB JJR NN IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN RB VBP IN DT VBZ JJ , IN RB .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB , IN DT NNS , DT JJ NN .
we have to start making the real world more like a game . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB VBG DT JJ NN RBR IN DT NN .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ VBP PRP$ NN IN NN WDT VBD CD NNS RB .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ? [ pos tagging ] DT VBP JJ NN , VBD IN IN NN POS NNS . NN .
before we had a@@ wes@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD JJ NN NNS , PRP VBD VBN POS NNS .

and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .

her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ IN NNS , RB JJ NNS , VBD VBN IN DT NN IN NN IN DT NN IN NN .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy . [ pos tagging ] RB , EX VBD JJ DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN VBD IN PRP VBD TO VB NN NN .
people were suffering . people were fighting . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBD VBG . NNS VBD VBG .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT JJ NN , PRP VBD DT JJ NN .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .

and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .

so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .

the first is that we will not evol@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ VBZ IN PRP MD RB VB .
we have reach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN DT NN IN NN .
and the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preser@@ ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .

a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN EX MD VB NN IN DT JJ NN , JJ , VBN IN DT NNS IN NN .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN RB MD VB IN DT NNS IN NN NN RB , CC PRP VBP JJ .

but play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBZ DT NN .
play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quie@@ t , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w . [ pos tagging ] NN POS DT NN , CC PRP MD VB JJ NNS , DT IN WDT VBP RBR JJ , JJ , JJ : RB WRB NN VBZ VBN RB .

so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP CD NNS IN JJS IN WP NN VBP .
as the one hat , i do history of an@@ atom@@ y . [ pos tagging ] IN DT CD NN , JJ VBP NN IN NN .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concep@@ ts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .

the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN JJ VBP VBN IN PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT NN , IN DT NN NN : CC , IN JJ NNS VBP , IN DT JJ NN : IN NNS WP VBP NNS IN NNS .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , WP VBZ VBP VBN IN VBZ NNS WP VBP NN NNS IN VBP JJ NNS .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body . [ pos tagging ] RB DT IN WP NN VBP VBN IN , IN NN , VBZ NNS WP VBP VBN NNS : CD NNS IN CD NN .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical . [ pos tagging ] DT IN WP NN VBP VBN IN VBZ NNS WP VBP NN : RB NNS WP VBP RB JJR IN JJ .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ yp@@ ical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN WP NN VBP VBN IN VBZ NNS WP VBP JJ NN : RB NNS WP VBP NNS VBP DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN NN NNS .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN , PRP MD VB DT NN NN IN DT .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ IN DT NN IN JJ NNS .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female . [ pos tagging ] JJ MD RB VB PRP DT JJ NNS IN DT NNS IN NNS PRP MD VB NN WDT VBZ MD VB IN NN CC NN .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an x@@ y chromo@@ so@@ mal basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chromo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ stes . [ pos tagging ] RB IN CD NN , PRP MD VB NN WP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN , CC IN JJ NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ DT NNS , WDT PRP DT VBP IN DT JJ NN , TO VB NNS .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN DT JJ NN DT NNS VBP VBG RP NN .
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ VBZ NNS TO VB IN NN , DT NN JJ NNP NN TO DT NN .
and this is a syndro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN VBN NN NN NN .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it . [ pos tagging ] RB NNS IN NNS IN NN , CC DT NN TO PRP .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ RBR IN DT JJ JJ NN .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl . [ pos tagging ] WRB DT NN VBZ VBN , PRP VBZ IN DT NN .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN . PRP VBZ VBN IN DT NN .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody fig@@ ures out something &apos;s up here . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB RB IN PRP VBZ NN CC PRP VBZ VBG CC VBG NNS , CC PRP VBZ RB VBG PRP$ NN , IN NN NNS RP NN POS RP RB .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ var@@ ies inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ stes inside , and she has a y chromo@@ some . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT NNS CC NN RP IN , RB IN VBG NNS IN CC DT NN , PRP RB VBZ NNS IN , CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not . [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBZ JJ TO VB VBZ PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN RB VBG JJ , CC PRP VBP RB RB .
fe@@ males , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands . [ pos tagging ] NNS , IN NNS , VBP IN PRP$ NNS NN VBN DT JJ NNS .
they &apos;re in the back of our body . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NNS VBP NNS , WDT VBP DT VBG NN .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chromo@@ so@@ mal ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ males like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive . [ pos tagging ] JJS NNS IN PRP : JJ VBP PRP TO VB DT JJ NN : JJ VBP POS RB VB PRP$ JJ JJ CC JJ VBP JJ VBP RB JJ : JJS NNS IN PRP VBP RB JJ .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG NN , CC PRP VBP VBG TO NNS .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with te@@ stes who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .

so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBZ RB VBN : PRP VBZ RB RB IN JJ NNS VBP IN DT NN IN PDT DT NN NN : IN DT NNS , PRP MD VB DT IN DT NN .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ var@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .

what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asia . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBD VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBN JJ JJ NN .
he had x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN NNS , CC IN DT NN , PRP$ JJ NNS VBD IN JJ JJ NN IN PRP VBD , RB , DT JJ JJ NN .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine compon@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , PRP$ NNS VBD VBN , PRP$ NN VBD JJ TO DT RBR JJ JJ NN IN NNS .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody sus@@ pe@@ cted anything . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD VBN VBG IN DT NN : NN VBD NN .
and it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .

some people who have x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS WP VBP VBN NNS VB WP VBP VBN NN , WDT VBZ WRB PRP VBP JJ NN IN JJ NN VBD IN PRP .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP RB RB JJ WRB DT VBZ .
so sex can come in lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties . [ pos tagging ] RB NN MD VB IN NNS IN JJ NNS .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .

in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NNS , NNS VBP RB RB JJ .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories . [ pos tagging ] DT NN PRP VBP RB JJ TO JJ NNS IN NNS VBZ IN PRP VBP PRP$ JJ NNS .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBZ VBN VBN RB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN IN WP PRP VBZ TO VB DT NN VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN : WP PRP VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN VBZ , RB , VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNS IN PRP$ NN .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN WDT RB VBZ PRP NN RB JJ , PRP VBZ PRP IN NNS IN DT NNS .

where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ lin .

in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .

what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ? [ pos tagging ] WDT VBP PRP TO VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBP IN PRP RB RB IN DT JJ NNS .

so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN TO VB PRP IN DT NN , NN VBP TO VB NN TO PRP IN VBP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT VBG NNS .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP PRP VBD NNS , NNS VBP PRP VBD JJ , CC PRP VBD JJ .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP , PRP VBD RB JJ CC RB JJ CC RB JJ IN WP PRP VBD IN NN VBP PRP VBG IN NN JJ `` CD `` DT JJ NNS , CC PRP VBZ RB IN IN DT NN , WDT VBZ RB JJ .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN IN WP VBD IN CD IN DT VBG NNS .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why . [ pos tagging ] DT VBG NNS VBD , IN PRP$ NN IN NN , DT JJ JJ NNS , CC DT VBZ WRB .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBD VBD DT JJ NN CC VBD PRP IN DT NN WDT VBD JJ CC JJ CC VBD PRP IN CD NNS .
so as you all rec@@ all , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP DT VBP , WP PRP$ VBG NNS VBD VBG VBD DT NN IN NN , CC DT NN VBD RB VBN IN DT RB JJ NN IN NN .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN NNS VBP DT NN IN NN , CC PRP VBD VB DT NN IN NN .
they had a concept of blue blood . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN JJ NN .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NNS WP MD VB IN JJ NN MD VB IN JJ NN IN IN DT NN VBG VBN IN IN NN TO VB TO VB CC RB JJ .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal . [ pos tagging ] DT VBG NNS VBD IN NN , CC PRP VBD PRP IN DT JJ JJ NN , CC DT NN VBD DT NNS VBP VBN JJ .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that ma@@ tter@@ ed was the common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN VBG NN CC VBD DT NN WDT VBD VBD DT NN IN NN , RB DT NN IN NN , CC DT VBD DT RB JJ NN TO VB .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBD VBG PRP IN NN IN PRP VBD NN IN DT NN NN WRB CD NNS VBD VBG RP RB .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD NN VBG RP , CC PRP VBD RB NN VBG RP IN DT JJ NN .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB JJ , IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT VBG NNS , DT NN IN PRP VBD RB JJ IN NN , CC PRP VBD JJ IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very va@@ gue concept of birth@@ right . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBG RB IN JJ NNS , CC PRP VBD VBG NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NN , WRB PRP VBD IN IN DT RB JJ NN IN NN .
they were moving towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBG NNS DT JJ NN .
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP , IN NN , IN DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP IN NN CC NN POS NN .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN IN NN CC NN POS NN .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN IN NN TO VB PRP WP PRP VBP .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN IN DT , PRP VBD VBG TO PRP IN DT NN WDT VBD RB JJ NN .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future . [ pos tagging ] CC IN VBG RB , PRP VBD RB VBG RP IN DT JJ NN DT JJ NNS NN IN DT NN .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN IN PRP DT NN , CC PRP VBD PRP IN PRP , CC PRP VBD JJ .
so what happened years after@@ ward ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBD NNS RB .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot; [ pos tagging ] WP VBD VBD NNS , IN NN , WP VBD DT NN TO VB , VBD DT JJ NNS POS NN IN JJ NN VBG RBR JJ IN JJ NN CC VBD , `` DT NN IN PRP VBP DT NN CC NNS VBZ RB JJ RB IN NNS IN DT NN TO VB IN PRP VBP NNS VBP DT NN TO VB , DT NN TO JJ NN , DT NN TO JJ NN , FW . , FW . ``

next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; a@@ in &apos;t i a woman ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] JJ VBD DT JJ JJ NNS NN , WRB PRP VBD NNS IN NN NN VBG IN , `` VBP MD VB DT NN . ``
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS IN DT NN NNS IN DT JJ NNS NN VBG , `` NN VBP DT NN . ``

we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NN NNS NN .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ , IN NN , RB , IN PRP VBP TO VB IN PDT DT NN , PRP VBP TO VB TO VB WRB PRP VBP JJ NNS .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture . [ pos tagging ] RB NN PRP , VB VBP TO VB DT NNS , RB , IN PRP$ NN .

well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers . [ pos tagging ] RB , RB TO VB , NN VBP TO VB TO PRP IN VBP VBP VBN VBG DT NN IN DT NNS .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP TO VB IN DT NNS IN WP NN MD VB IN , CC MD VB VBN IN , IN PRP VBD RBR VBN DT NNS .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP TO VB NN DT JJ NN JJ IN DT NN , CC DT VBZ IN JJ VBP IN EX MD VB JJ NNS IN NNS WDT MD VB IN JJ NNS IN NNS , RB WRB PRP VBP NNS VBG IN NNS .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NNS , IN JJ VBP VBN JJ IN NN , NN VBP RB VBN JJ IN NN NN NN .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fe@@ males in terms of the way they think and operate in the world . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN DT NNS WDT VBP VBP VBN RB JJ IN VBZ VBG IN DT NNS IN NNS CC NNS IN NNS IN DT NN PRP VBP CC VBP IN DT NN .
and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ males , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBP IN JJ NNS VBZ IN NNS , IN NN : RB NN , CC IN NN : VBP RBR JJ TO VB RB JJ TO JJ JJ NNS CC TO VBG NN IN NNS WP VBP RB JJ IN DT NN .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN PRP VBP IN DT , PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question . [ pos tagging ] NNS RB , WRB NN VBD IN JJ NN , CD IN PRP$ NN NNS WP VBD NN VBD JJ IN NN : NN VBD PRP DT NN , IN NN RB VBP : VBD DT RB JJ NN .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD , `` VB PRP WP VBZ NN IN NN . ``
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard . [ pos tagging ] CC VB NN , `` VBP DT VBZ DT JJS NN NN VBP RB VBN .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot; [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ DT IN JJ NNS IN NN , IN EX VBZ NN NN IN NN . ``
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJR JJ VBD IN PRP$ NN , DT JJR JJ VBD EX MD VB NN JJ IN NN .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ TO VB , EX MD VB NN , IN JJ , JJ IN JJ NNS IN NN NNS WDT VBZ PRP RBR JJ TO VB JJ JJ NNS CC RBR JJ TO VBG NN IN DT JJ .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NNS VBD RB JJ TO VBG RP WRB TO VB NNS IN DT NN , PRP VBZ JJ IN IN PRP VBD JJR NNS IN DT NN , WP PRP MD VB VBZ JJR IN DT NN IN , RB RB WRB TO VB , CC WRB TO VB IN DT JJ .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN , WRB PRP VBP JJ IN NN , VBZ TO VB JJR IN DT JJ NN , IN NNS IN DT NN , CC VB JJR IN DT NNS .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other . [ pos tagging ] RB IN IN PRP DT NNS VBP TO VB DT RBR JJ NN , PRP VBP VBG IN WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ .

you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VB TO VB DT NN IN NN TO VB JJ .

good after@@ noon , everybody . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , NN .
i &apos;ve got something to show you . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN NN TO VB PRP .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el . [ pos tagging ] VB RB DT IN DT NN , DT VBG NN .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WP PRP VBP , IN PRP$ NN , JJ NN .
let me tell you a bit about it . [ pos tagging ] VB PRP VB PRP DT NN IN PRP .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP DT NN : JJ VBP JJ RB , CC DT NN IN NN VBZ RP IN DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN : CC DT NN NN VBP VBG PRP DT VBZ IN NN RB JJ VBN IN NN CD NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN RB , IN PRP VBD TO VB DT NN CD NN , PRP VBP DT NN , CC PRP VB PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN CC DT NN VBD JJ RB , RB PRP MD VB DT NN .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted . [ pos tagging ] RB NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN , RB PRP VBP RB NN IN DT : NN WDT VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN , VBZ DT JJ CD NNS VBG NN IN DT NN , VBG DT NN IN DT NN , CC RB VBG PRP CC VBG PRP IN NN TO VB RB TO DT NN IN NNS CC VBG NNS IN JJ NN IN NN VBZ VBN .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WP , IN NN NNS , PRP MD VB DT JJ NN NN NN .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBZ DT NN VBN IN CD NNS : DT NN CC DT JJ NN .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives . [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ VBG NN VBZ IN JJ NN NN NNS VBP VBG TO VB IN PRP$ NNS .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electr@@ on@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NNS , IN DT JJ JJ NNS , RB VBP VBN VBN IN NNS , NNS .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG IN NNS IN JJ NN .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated . [ pos tagging ] CC , IN NNS IN JJ NN , PRP VBP VBG TO VB IN DT JJ NN TO VB JJ TO VB VBN CC TO VB VBN .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NNS , RB PRP VBZ DT JJ NN .
just as an asi@@ de , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN , RB VBD TO VB , NNS VBP RB CD NN IN DT NN POS NN , CC PRP VBP CD NN IN DT NN POS NN .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP CD NN IN DT NN NN : IN TO CD NN IN JJ NNS .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP JJ TO VB NN IN NNS , DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is enter@@ ing our everyday objects . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS , DT IN DT NN CC NN VBZ VBG PRP$ JJ NNS .
that &apos;s from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is organi@@ zing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT NN WDT NN NN VBZ VBG IN NN RBR DT NN , IN DT NN .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN `` NN TO PRP . ``
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP$ NNS , PRP$ NN VBZ VBG TO VB RB TO PRP .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an actu@@ ator . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ RB IN IN DT NN IN EX VBD VBG CC DT NN CC DT NN .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB VBG DT NN PRP VBP IN NNS IN DT NN IN RB .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ... [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ RB IN IN DT JJ NN IN NN :
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , WRB NN VBD DT NNS , IN DT NN PRP VBD IN PRP VBD DT NN , VBD PRP IN DT NNS : RB PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN NN : CC VBD , VBD , `` NN NN NN .

well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT JJ NN NN VBD TO NN IN PRP VBZ RB CD IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN .
it was four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD CD CC DT JJ NNS RB IN NN .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been de@@ plo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .

the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBD DT JJ NN : CD .
it &apos;s when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ WRB JJ VBD DT NN NN NN .
some of you might remember , it was it@@ al@@ y and fr@@ ance playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt . [ pos tagging ] DT IN PRP MD VB , PRP VBD JJ CC NN NN , CC RB NN IN DT NN , DT NN .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , JJ VBD IN DT NN .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing activity happening on the network . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP IN WP VBD DT NN RB IN VBG NN VBG IN DT NN .
here you see the city . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN .
you see the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN , DT NN NN .
it &apos;s morning , before the match . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NN , IN DT NN .

hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room . [ pos tagging ] NN , NNS VBP DT JJ NN CC VB TO DT NN .

zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment . [ pos tagging ] NN , DT NN IN DT NN .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah . [ pos tagging ] NN NNS . NN .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te in the center . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT NN , NN VBD TO VB IN DT NN .
you saw the big peak . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT JJ NN .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the w@@ inning team and the prime minister at the time . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN , RB NN VBD TO DT NN TO VB DT VBG NN CC DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
and then everybody moved down . [ pos tagging ] CC RB NN VBD RB .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to celebra@@ te , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN VBN NN NN , WRB , IN NN NNS , NNS VBP TO VB , TO VB DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ RB CD NN IN WRB PRP MD VB DT NN NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP NNS VBP VBN RB DT JJ NNS RB .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN NN : PRP VBZ RB IN NNS , CC IN NNS PRP VBP CC VBP .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from . [ pos tagging ] RB NN , PRP VBP NN IN WRB PRP$ NNS VBN IN .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ PRP PDT DT NNS WDT VBP DT NN NN , WRB PRP VBD RB .
but we know very little about where things go . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP RB JJ IN WRB NNS VBP .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN , PRP RB VBD DT JJ NNS TO VB NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN .
so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ attle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP RB VBD IN DT NN IN NNS WP VBD PRP IN NN , RB IN DT NN RB , TO VB WP PRP VBD VBG RB : JJ NNS IN NNS , IN PRP MD VB RB : NNS PRP MD VB RP RB .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBD DT JJ NN , JJ NN , IN DT NN CC RB VBD VBG PRP .
here are the results we just ob@@ tain@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP DT NNS PRP RB VBD .
from se@@ attle ... [ pos tagging ] IN NN :
after one week . [ pos tagging ] IN CD NN .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN PRP VBD EX VBZ DT NN IN NNS IN DT NN .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN IN JJ JJR NN .
this data was not available before . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBD RB JJ RB .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transpor@@ tation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN CC JJ NNS VBG .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ IN PRP VBP IN IN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBP VBG RB , PRP VBZ CD NN , PRP VBZ RB RB IN DT NN .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN PRP VBP VBG RB DT NN RB VBZ RB .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ oral change . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP IN TO NNS , RB PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN .
so that was the reason for the project . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBD DT NN IN DT NN .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .

and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ NN PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS RB IN NN , NN .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .

and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ? [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBD : WRB MD NN , JJ NN , VB VBN TO DT .
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , ta@@ ps , opening and clo@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN DT NNS WDT VBD VBN IN NN IN DT NN VBD , VB DT NN , CC PRP VBP VBN NNS , JJ NNS , NNS , VBG CC NN .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN NN IN NNS VBN IN NN .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS VBP , PRP MD VB IN PRP , PRP MD VB NNS , NNS , NN .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD VB PRP , CC PRP MD VB RP TO VB PRP VB RB , IN PRP VBP IN DT NN .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ loch . [ pos tagging ] RB , PRP VBD DT TO VB NN .
he liked it very much . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP RB RB .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD DT NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP JJ NN NN .
the whole building is made of water . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN NN .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NNS CC NNS , CC WRB PRP VBP PRP , PRP MD VB RP TO VB PRP IN .
the roof also is covered with water . [ pos tagging ] DT NN RB VBZ VBN IN NN .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof . [ pos tagging ] CC IN EX VBZ DT NN IN NN , IN PRP VBP TO VB NN , PRP MD RB VB DT NN .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB DT NN , CC DT JJ NN MD VB , PRP VBP , DT NNS , PRP RB VB NNS IN DT NN , WRB PRP VBP DT NN RP , IN NNS WP VBP VBN EX CC VBD , `` PRP VBD DT NN . ``
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars . [ pos tagging ] DT , PRP VBP '' JJ PRP , RB WRB PRP VBZ RB , DT NN RB NNS .
here &apos;s the building working . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT NN NN .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN VBD IN WP VBD VBG IN NN .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , testing the sensor@@ s that open the water . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBD PRP VBG RB TO VB JJ , VBG DT NNS WDT VBP DT NN .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensor@@ s stopped working . [ pos tagging ] RB , NNS MD VB PRP RB WP VBD CD NN WRB DT IN DT NNS VBD VBG .
but actually that night , it was even more fun . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN , PRP VBD RB JJR NN .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different . [ pos tagging ] PDT DT NNS IN NN VBD TO DT NN , IN DT NN IN VBG IN DT NN VBD NN JJ .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting we@@ t . [ pos tagging ] RB RB DT NN WDT MD VB RP TO VB PRP IN , CC DT NN WDT MD RB VB NNS CC NNS IN DT NN , CC PRP VBD TO VB IN VBG NN .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architec@@ ts , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD , IN PRP , VBD RB JJ , RB , IN NNS , IN NNS , IN NNS , PRP RB VBP IN WRB NNS MD VB DT NNS PRP VBP .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predic@@ table . [ pos tagging ] CC RB NN POS RB JJ .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN IN VBG NNS WDT VBP VBN CC JJ IN NNS .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT NN RB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NNS , DT NNS VBN IN NN , CC RB NNS IN PRP .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WDT VBD PRP TO VB IN DT JJ NN VBZ MD VB PRP RB .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ , VB DT NNS MD RB VB VBG .
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP MD VB JJ NNS WDT VBP IN DT NN , CC RB DT IN PRP IN DT JJ NN IN VBG NNS : RB IN DT NN WDT MD VB IN NN .
here is the video . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT NN .
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chr@@ ony . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ CD NN , IN DT CD PRP VBD IN , VBG IN NNS , IN NN .
so you can have this cloud . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT NN .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regular con@@ figu@@ ration in two dimensions . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN JJ NN CC NN , IN DT : DT JJ NN IN CD NNS .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position . [ pos tagging ] CC IN JJ , CC IN CD NNS , WRB DT NN IN NNS VBZ DT NN , RB DT NNS POS NN .
you can play with a different type . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution . [ pos tagging ] VB PRP$ NN MD RB VB IN JJ NNS CC NNS , JJ NNS IN NN .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many direc@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT JJ NN MD VB RB DT CD NN IN NNS IN PRP MD VB CC VB IN PRP CC VB IN JJ , JJ NNS .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT JJ NN NN CC VBG RB TO VB DT JJ NN IN RB .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN , RB PRP VBP DT . RB DT JJ IN PRP VBD IN .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people . [ pos tagging ] CC VB DT IN PRP RB VBN IN NNS .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN VBG DT NN WDT VBZ IN NNS , IN NNS POS NN , CC RB CC RB .
i want to show you something here for the first time . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP TO VB PRP NN RB IN DT JJ NN .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN VBG IN JJ NN , CD IN NN POS JJ NN NNS : DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NN CC NN NN IN NN : CC RB VBD PRP$ NN IN CD IN NN TO VB PRP IN DT NN IN NN .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP MD VB JJ NN .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT VBN DT NNS , DT JJ NNS VBG VBN .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion capture . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT CD NN IN JJ NN CC NN NN .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN .
you can go all the way through . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PDT DT NN IN .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , RB PRP VBP DT NNS , RB PRP MD VB IN PRP CC VB IN NN CC NN CC NN CC NN .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP TO VB DT IN CD IN DT JJ NNS IN NN .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on . [ pos tagging ] RB VBD TO VB PRP DT JJ NN PRP VBP VBG IN .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NN PRP VBP VBG IN IN DT NN NNS .
it &apos;s called the cloud . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN DT NN .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN RB VBZ , NN , RB , PRP MD VB NNS IN VBG NN CC VBG PRP$ NN : RB TO VB WP PRP VBP JJ NN : IN NN NN , CC IN DT NN .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP MD VB NN VB DT JJ NN IN CD NN .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP WP VBZ JJ WDT VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS VBZ IN , IN DT JJ NN IN NNS , PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN TO DT JJ NN .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ VBN VBG NN , NN , CC VBG DT JJ IN DT NN .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one . [ pos tagging ] RB NN , IN DT JJ NN : CC DT NN NN VBD PRP DT : PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN , IN DT JJ NN IN NNS , TO DT JJ CD .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB , IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP TO VB PRP IN VBG CC VBG DT NN .
that means something built in a city . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ NN VBN IN DT NN .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pres@@ sing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one . [ pos tagging ] CC NN PRP MD VB , IN NN TO VB NN POS NN NNS : VBP IN NN NN CC NN NNS : WRB PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN TO DT JJ CD .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ c@@ tively . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN PRP MD RB VB NNS IN VBG DT NN RB , RB .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ DT NN , RB , VBN IN NNS , IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN VBN IN NNS .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS VBP NN , WRB PRP$ NN VBZ DT NN IN NNS .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN , CC VBD IN NNS .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RB , VBP JJ NNS IN NNS .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB IN NN , VBG DT JJ NNS IN DT NNS IN CD CC IN , CC RB VBG PRP IN DT NN TO VB IN DT NN .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top . [ pos tagging ] RB PDT DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC NN PRP MD VB TO DT JJ CC # CD : IN CC # CD : , IN NN POS JJ NN .
you can enter inside it . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN PRP .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN JJ JJ NN IN DT NN : CC JJS RB , DT JJ NN IN NN IN NN WP MD VB TO DT NN .

the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .

ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP VBN WRB PRP VBP IN IN NNS CC VB IN IN NN NNS .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ PRP$ JJ JJ NN .
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN VBG IN PRP$ NN CC PRP$ NNS .

it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .

i have had the distin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN TO VB VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NNS .
but the cool@@ est i ever worked on was around this guy . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJS NN RB VBD IN VBD IN DT NN .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t . [ pos tagging ] DT NN POS NN VBZ JJ .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD CD IN DT NN NN NNS IN DT CD .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD RP NN IN DT JJ CD NN CC VBD , `` NN , PRP$ NNS VBP VBG . ``
and that was the on@@ set of als . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD DT NN IN NNS .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBZ RB RB VBN .
he only has use of his eyes . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ NN IN PRP$ NNS .
i was ex@@ posed to him . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD VBN TO PRP .
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP DT NN WDT VBZ NN CC NN , RB RB JJ VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN WP PRP VBP CC VBP IN DT NN NN .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor tony , temp@@ t , and his cause . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBD IN PRP VBD VBG TO VB NN , NN , CC PRP$ NN .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD CC VBD IN PRP$ NN CC NN CC VBD , `` PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP DT NN .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] WP VBP PRP VBG TO VB IN PRP . ``
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN VBD , `` NN RB VB TO VB JJ TO VB TO VB RB .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] NN RB VB TO VB JJ TO VB IN PRP CC NN VBD , `` VBP DT JJ , JJ POS DT : VB VBP VBN NN VBG : VB POS DT JJ NNS VBP DT NN TO VB IN DT NNS . ``
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upp@@ er ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD , `` DT , IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN CC PRP VBP VBN RB JJ NN , PRP MD VB RB VBP DT .
these devices aren &apos;t acc@@ essi@@ ble to people . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP VBZ JJ TO NNS . ``
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD , `` RB , WRB VBP PRP RB VB . ``
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] VBZ NN VBN DT NN `` DT NN NN CC DT NN . ``
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP : RB VB PRP$ NN IN .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] NN VBD , `` DT VBZ RB . WRB MD IN VB . ``
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to c@@ ash . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBD RP IN DT NN TO RB VB DT NN , CC RB , JJ VBD DT NN IN NN VBD DT VBG NN WRB NN VBD VBG TO NN .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .

because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN WP RB VBZ DT IN DT IN PRP VBP '' JJ TO VB PRP . ``
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP IN DT NN DT JJ NNS IN DT .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD DT NNS VBD NN , JJ NN NN , CC PRP VBP DT NN WDT VBZ PRP TO VB DT JJ IN DT NN CC RB , IN DT NN NN , NN IN PRP , CC PRP RB VBZ DT JJ NN .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP RB CC VB JJ NNS IN DT .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle . [ pos tagging ] PDT DT NNS WDT VBP RB RB , PRP VBD EX VBZ DT NN NN .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush s@@ lan@@ ders and then people actually got to art . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NNS , RB PRP VBZ IN NN NNS , RB PRP VBD JJ NNS CC RB NNS RB VBD TO VB .
but there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBD RB DT NN NN TO PRP$ NNS .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD NN CC VBD VBG NN IN PRP$ NN CC VBD VBG PRP$ IN DT , CC PRP VBD JJ , `` RB VB DT JJ .

so that started the journey . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBD DT NN .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things . [ pos tagging ] CC IN CD NNS RB , IN DT NN RB , IN DT NN IN NN CC DT NN IN VBG NNS RB , PRP MD VB DT JJ NNS .
one , we bat@@ ter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ sur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine . [ pos tagging ] CD , PRP VBD RP DT NNS IN DT NN NNS , CC PRP RB VBD JJ DT NN WDT VBD PRP VB : DT JJ NN NN .
which was a@@ wes@@ ome . [ pos tagging ] WDT VBD JJ .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB CD IN DT JJS : VB VBP PRP RB , IN PRP VBP TO DT NN , PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP , CC PRP VBP IN , `` NN VBP RB JJ .

the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBZ PRP VBD CD NNS IN DT IN DT NN : RB DT NN IN DT NN : IN PRP$ NN .

a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .

so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN IN DT CD NNS , PRP VBD RB TO VB POS NN .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP DT NN , IN DT VBZ NN RB POS NN CC DT VBZ PRP$ NN .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling . [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBZ PDT DT NN CC NN VBG IN IN DT JJ NN .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , carb@@ -@@ fest and all@@ -@@ night s@@ essi@@ ons , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years . [ pos tagging ] CC IN IN DT NN IN NN , CD NNS IN NN , JJ CC JJ NNS , JJ NN RB IN DT JJ NN IN CD NNS .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT JJ NN , IN DT VBZ PRP$ NN NN NN , CC PRP VBZ VBG IN PRP$ NN NN NN .
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP$ NN RB IN PRP MD VB RP .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hospital . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP RP DT NN IN DT NN RP IN DT NN NN IN IN PRP$ NN .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD RB IN DT JJ NN , IN NN IN PRP$ NN CC NNS : CC PRP MD RB VB WP DT NN IN DT NN NN VBD .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the par@@ king lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBD , PRP VBD TO VB IN DT NN NN RB , IN PRP RB VBD IN PRP VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN NN RB .

isn &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ? [ pos tagging ] NN POS IN NN .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ NN IN PRP$ NN NN .
that &apos;s what kee@@ ps us going and kee@@ ps us developing . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ WP VBZ PRP VBG CC VB PRP VBG .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP VBN PDT DT JJ NN TO VB IN DT .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN DT NN .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more . [ pos tagging ] CC NN WP VBZ DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS RB RB RBR .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stron@@ ger . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN VBG TO VB RP WRB TO VB PRP JJR , RBR , JJR .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP VBP VBD DT NNS IN NN .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBD DT NN IN NNS .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing . [ pos tagging ] NN , PRP VBZ JJ : NN IN PRP VBP VBG DT NN IN DT NN .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT VBG IN IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB DT NNS VBD IN , `` UH , DT VBZ JJ . ``
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool . [ pos tagging ] RB VBN IN PRP , CC RB IN NNP , NN NN VBD PRP IN CD IN DT JJ CD NNS IN CD , WDT VBD RB JJ .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in apri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ffen mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT JJS NN IN DT : CC DT VBZ WP VBZ VBG DT JJ NN : VBZ IN IN NN IN DT NN , IN DT NN NN IN JJ NN NNS , EX VBZ VBG TO VB DT NN VBN `` NN IN DT NNS . ``
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the street art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .

so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible . [ pos tagging ] RB RB DT VBZ PRP$ NN : IN PRP VBP NN WDT VBZ RB JJ , VB PRP JJ .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point . [ pos tagging ] NN IN DT NN VBZ POS JJ : DT NN , DT NN , DT NN , DT NN : JJ POS JJ IN CD NN .
make it possible , everyone in this room . [ pos tagging ] VB PRP JJ , NN IN DT NN .

now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP TO NN IN PRP CD NNS RB VBD IN PRP DT NN .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN PRP DT NNS IN DT NN .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to men@@ d , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .

as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBD IN DT NN IN , NN VBD RB IN DT NN , WDT VBZ , `` JJ VBP JJ NNS . ``
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it . [ pos tagging ] IN IN DT NN VBZ JJ CC DT NN VBZ RB , JJ VBP VBG PRP .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne anything in life . [ pos tagging ] NN RB RBR VBP TO VB NN IN NN .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN , WDT NN , VBZ RB VBN PRP$ NN .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN VBD DT NN : CC DT VBZ IN PRP VBP DT NN NN NN , WDT VBD IN RB DT NN : JJ VBD RB , NN , VBP RB VB CD JJ NN .
i &apos;ve lived a good life . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN DT JJ NN .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ JJ NN CC NNS , JJ VBP VBN TO VB JJR IN NN NN VBD .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP$ NN , NN RB VB PRP$ NN TO VB IN .
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD DT NN NN VBD IN NNS WDT VBD RB VB IN NNS IN NN .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN , IN PRP$ NNS , IN NNS .
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to elimin@@ ate negative energy from my life . [ pos tagging ] CC IN , IN NN VBD IN IN , VB VBD TO VB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC PRP VBZ DT NN RBR .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP RB VBD DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN CD NNS .
it feels great . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy . [ pos tagging ] NN RB RB VB TO VB JJ : VB VBP TO VB JJ .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN VBN : CC DT VBZ IN PRP$ JJ NN VBZ VBG , `` CD , CD , CD . ``

it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB IN PRP VBP VBN VBG IN PRP PRP$ JJ NNS .
but it was very sad . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD RB JJ .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP RBS VBP TO VB : RB VBP PRP$ NN .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN RB VBN IN CD NN , WDT VBZ , VBZ RB JJ IN CD NN .

the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP '' VBP NN TO VB DT NN .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ anz ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facili@@ ty . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ JJ NN IN VBG JJ NNS VBZ DT JJ NN NN NN .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBP , DT VBP JJ NN NNS .
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS WDT VBP JJ NNS CC NNS , PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN NNS IN DT NN .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS VBP JJ NN NNS NN : PRP VBP DT RB JJ NN .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we are in business . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NNS VBP IN DT NN WDT VBZ VBN IN DT NN NN TO VB DT JJ NN , RB PRP VBP IN NN .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN IN NN .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP IN DT NNS NN .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN , NNS DT NN , CC DT JJ JJ NN VBZ VBN : NN VBD .
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ? [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ , VB .
i want to tell you how we found that out . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP TO VB PRP WRB PRP VBD IN RP .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was . [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN NN CD NNS RB , PRP VBD RB JJ WP DT NN IN DT NN VBD .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN WDT VBD VBN VBZ PRP VBZ RB , RB JJ IN DT NNS NN , DT JJ NN , VBD JJ JJ NNS .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD TO VB TO VB NN IN DT JJ NNS , DT JJ NN NNS .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBD PRP$ NN , CC PRP VBD DT NN NN WRB PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN NN CC VBD DT NN RP .
and then some very funny things happened . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT RB JJ NNS VBD .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ MD VB PRP$ NN : JJ , CC VBP CD VBP TO VB .
didn &apos;t make sense to me . [ pos tagging ] NN '' VBP NN TO PRP .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a direc@@ ted attack . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBD IN JJ NNS IN NN , NN VBN , RB , DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s completely direc@@ ted . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB VBN .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gra@@ y box if a specific con@@ figu@@ ration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG RB IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ VBN , CC RB IN DT JJ NN NN IN PRP VBZ VBG TO VB VBZ RB VBG IN DT NN .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing . [ pos tagging ] CC IN RB , NN VBZ NN .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is . [ pos tagging ] RB IN RB VBD PRP$ NN , CC PRP VBD TO VB IN DT RB IN DT NN , IN NN VBD , `` RB , PRP VBP '' VBP WP DT NN VBZ .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB , VB POS VB IN NN , DT JJ NN NN , CC DT NN NN IN NN .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP VB RP WP DT NN VBZ RB . ``
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD CC VBD DT NN NN , CC PRP VBD IN PRP VBZ VBN IN CD JJ NNS : DT JJR CD CC DT JJR CD .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBD IN PRP VBP RB RB VBN IN NNS WP RB VBD DT NN NN .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PDT DT NNS CC NNS IN PRP VBD TO VB .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RB VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
so they know everything . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP NN .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN IN NN VBZ JJ CC JJ , VB PRP VB PRP DT : DT NN VBZ JJ NN .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NN IN NN IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN .

we are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG IN : IN IN CD NNS IN NN .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assem@@ bly language . [ pos tagging ] VBZ RB JJ IN JJ NN NN .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP TO VB PRP WRB PRP VBD JJ TO VB NN IN IN DT NN .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBD VBG IN VBZ , RB IN DT , NN NN VBZ , IN PRP VBP WP PRP VBP .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD VBG IN NNS CC NNS NNS CC VBG TO VB PRP TO DT JJ NN : TO JJ JJ NN NNS .
so we do need target theor@@ ies that we can prove or dis@@ prove . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN NNS IN PRP MD VB CC VB .
in order to get target theor@@ ies , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted . [ pos tagging ] IN NN TO VB NN NNS , PRP VBP IN PRP VBZ RB JJ NN , PRP MD VB DT JJ NN CC PRP VBZ RBS JJ VBN IN NN , IN DT VBZ WRB RBS IN DT NNS VBD VBN VBN .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP JJ VBP JJ CD NNS IN DT NN .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bus@@ he@@ hr nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ anz fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ RB TO DT NN JJ NN NN CC TO DT JJ NN NN NN .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD PRP$ NN , `` VB PRP DT NN IN DT NN CC NN NN NNS IN PRP$ NN NN . ``
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD PRP RP CC VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NN TO VB PRP$ NN IN WP PRP VBD IN NN CC NNS .
and that worked pretty well . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD RB RB .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN NN .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ IN VBG NN IN DT NN , WDT JJ NN IN PRP VBP .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBP RB JJ TO VB DT NN CC RB RB VBP DT NN NN .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP RB VBD VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN VBD RB TO VB PRP RB CC VB : RB IN DT NN TO VB NN NNS VBP , IN PRP MD RB VB JJ TO VB DT RP RB .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ JJ NN : PRP VBD DT NN IN DT IN VBG RB RB IN NNS CC NNS NNS .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , DT NN CD RB VBZ RP IN DT NN : PRP MD VB VB PRP .
i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD TO NN JJ NN IN WRB DT NNS VBP RB VBN IN NN CC VBD PRP VBP VBN IN WP VBZ VBN DT NN , CC DT NN VBZ CD NNS .
so that made sense , that was a match . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBD NN , WDT VBD DT NN .
and it even got better . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBD RBR .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS IN NN VBP VBN IN CD , WP VBZ VBN , NNS .
and guess what we found in the attack code ? [ pos tagging ] CC VB WP PRP VBD IN DT NN NN .
an almost iden@@ tical structure . [ pos tagging ] DT RB JJ NN .
so again , that was a real good match . [ pos tagging ] RB RB , DT VBD DT JJ JJ NN .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD PRP RB JJ NN IN WP PRP VBD VBG IN .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ CD VB PRP JJ RB , PRP VBZ '' VBP IN DT .
these results have been ob@@ tain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard labor . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP VBN VBN IN JJ NNS IN RB JJ NN .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBD IN RB DT JJ NN CC VBD TO VB .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gles . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP VBD RP IN DT JJ NNS VBD RB VBG IN CD CC DT JJ NN , CC IN JJ NNS .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ ca@@ de , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ VBG CD NN , CC VBG RP DT NNS CC VBG PRP RP , CC DT JJ NN VBZ VBG TO CD NNS CC VBG NNS .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT , PRP VBP RB JJ IN PRP VBP RB VBN WP DT NN VBZ .
it is nat@@ anz , and it is only nat@@ anz . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ , CC PRP VBZ RB JJ .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NNS VBP TO VB IN JJ NNS MD VB VBN IN NN .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN PRP VBD : RB VBD PRP$ NNS RP .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges . [ pos tagging ] IN EX VBZ DT JJ NN , CC IN DT JJ PRP VBP DT NNS .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensor@@ s -- so for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data . [ pos tagging ] RB WP DT NN VBZ VBZ PRP VBZ DT NN NNS IN NNS : RB IN NN , IN NN NNS CC NN NNS : CC PRP VBZ JJ NN NN , WDT VBZ RB VBG IN DT NN , IN JJ NN NNS .
and as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN IN NN , DT JJ NN NNS VBZ RB VBN IN NN .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded video . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ RB IN IN DT NN NNS WRB IN DT NN , DT NN NN VBZ VBN IN JJ NN .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ? [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ , VB .
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room . [ pos tagging ] DT NN RB VBZ RB RB RB TO VB DT NNS IN DT NN NN .
it actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ RB RBR JJ CC JJ .
the idea is to circum@@ vent a digital safety system . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN NN .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN NNS WRB DT JJ NN MD RB VB JJ RB .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open re@@ lief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , IN DT NN NN , WRB PRP$ JJ NN NN VBZ RB JJ NN , PRP MD VB NN NNS IN DT NN .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT MD RB VB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
so this is where we need digital safety systems . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ WRB PRP VBP JJ NN NNS .
and when they are com@@ promis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBP VBN , RB JJ JJ NNS MD VB .
your plant can b@@ low up . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN MD VB RP .
and nei@@ ther your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it . [ pos tagging ] CC DT PRP$ NNS CC PRP$ NN NN MD VB PRP .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ .
but it gets worse . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ JJR .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB JJ , WP VBZ VBP VBG TO VB .
think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic . [ pos tagging ] VB IN DT : DT NN VBZ JJ .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ NNS VBP NN TO VB , IN NNS , IN NNS , IN JJ NN .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automo@@ bile factory . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB RB RB , IN NN , IN DT NN NN CC IN DT NN NN .
it is gener@@ ic . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP '' VBP : IN DT NN : PRP VBP NNS VBP TO VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN , IN PRP VBD PRP IN DT NN IN NN .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD RB VB JJ NN NN IN VBG .
just spread it as wide as possible . [ pos tagging ] RB VB PRP RB JJ IN JJ .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT , WP PRP VBP RP IN VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN NN .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBP TO NN .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east . [ pos tagging ] RB RB , DT JJS NN IN NNS IN JJ NNS VBP RB IN DT JJ NN .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT JJ NNS CC NN CC IN NN .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environments . [ pos tagging ] RB DT IN DT JJ NNS , DT VBP PRP$ JJ NNS .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS , CC PRP JJR NN TO VB RB RB .
thanks . [ pos tagging ] NNS .
i &apos;ve got a question . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN DT NN .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ s@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this . [ pos tagging ] NN , PRP VBZ VBN RB RB VBD IN NNS VBP IN NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT .
is that your opini@@ on ? [ pos tagging ] VBZ IN PRP$ NN .
okay , you really want to hear that ? [ pos tagging ] NN , PRP RB VBP TO VB IN .
yeah . okay . [ pos tagging ] NN . NN .
my opini@@ on is that the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT NN VBZ VBN , CC IN DT VBG NN VBZ RB JJ .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBG NN IN DT VBZ DT NN NN .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ RB CD , CC DT VBZ DT JJ NNS : RB , RB .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger . [ pos tagging ] IN RB , PRP$ NNS MD RB VB JJR .
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP IN VBG DT NN NNS IN IN PRP . VB PRP , VB .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP VBN DT JJ JJ NNS VBG PRP IN NNS WDT VBP RB RB JJ CC IN DT JJ NN RB JJ .
i went to prison -- difficult . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBD TO NN : JJ .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN DT NN NN : JJ .
i fil@@ med in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN NN NNS : JJ CC JJ .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBD CD NNS VBG NN CC DT : NN IN DT NN , JJ JJ IN DT NN , RB JJ IN DT NN .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horri@@ ble situations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine socie@@ tal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertain@@ ing and acc@@ essi@@ ble to an audience . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , JJS IN PRP$ NN , JJ VBP VBN VBG PRP IN RB JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN IN VBG TO VB JJ NNS IN DT NN WDT VBP PRP VBG , WDT VBP PRP VBG , WDT RB VB PRP RP IN DT NN WDT VBP PRP VBG CC JJ TO DT NN .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different . [ pos tagging ] RB WRB JJ VBD NN VBD VBG RB TO VB DT JJ NN WDT VBD VBG TO VB IN DT NN IN NN CC NN , VBP VBD NNS MD VB TO VB NN DT JJ JJ .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT IN PRP MD CC MD RB VB VBN , DT NN NNS RB , VB VBD RP DT NN IN NN .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 ted talk . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RP DT NN NNS , DT NN NNS , CC NNS VBD NNS DT NN TO VB DT NN NNS TO PRP$ CD JJ NN .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ , DT JJ JJ , NN , JJ CC JJ , VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ NN : IN JJ VBP JJ NN NN MD RB VB PRP VB RB : TO VB DT NN NNS TO DT NN PRP VBP VBG RB RB , DT IN DT NN NN NNS VBP DT NN , NN POS RB VBP DT NN IN NN CC NN NNS RB VBP JJ NN IN TO WP DT JJ NN MD RB VB .
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBD VBG VBD DT : PRP$ NN RB VBZ : PRP$ JJ NN IN PRP VBP DT NN WP DT NN VBZ CC , VBG IN DT NN , MD RB VB RP IN PRP$ NN , RB IN JJ VBP PRP CC PRP$ NN VB JJ IN VBG PRP .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity . [ pos tagging ] CC IN VBG VBD , PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NNS NN .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP WRB JJ NNS VBP DT VBD NNS .
it &apos;s a lot . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN .
that &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT JJ NN , IN DT NN .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights . [ pos tagging ] RB RB IN DT NN , VB VBD IN NN MD VB DT NN NNS .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP MD VB VBN PRP IN DT NN RB , JJ VBP WDT VBP VBN JJ TO VB PRP IN IN DT NN .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN IN JJ VBP VBG IN , PRP$ JJ NN , PRP VBP DT NN IN NN , NN .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN VBD RBR , JJ VBD PRP IN DT RB JJ NNS IN DT NNS , CC NN MD VB PRP , NN MD VB PRP , IN NN IN JJ CC RB JJ IN VBG IN DT NNS IN DT NNS .
you see , i had this idea for a movie . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , VB VBD DT NN IN DT NN .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the entire film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] WP NN VBP TO VB VBZ VB DT NN DT IN NN NN , NN CC NN , WRB DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN NN NN , NN CC NN .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN MD VB VBN `` DT JJS NN RB VBN . ``
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x . [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBZ IN `` DT JJS NN RB VBN , `` VBZ IN NN IN JJ TO VB , IN NN TO VB , VBZ VBN IN VBG TO VB : IN DT JJ NN IN PRP MD VB IN DT NN , WDT VBZ NN NN .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ples center ... [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN , DT NN NN , DT NNS NN :
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS MD VB VBN TO DT NN IN NN : RB .
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN : PRP VBZ WP . IN NN , RB .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT JJ NN .
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD JJR IN NN .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD , `` IN NN . RB . ``
but not only are we going to have the brand x ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film . [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB VBP PRP VBG TO VB DT NN NNP NN NN , CC PRP VBP VBG TO VB JJ PRP VBP RP DT NN PRP MD IN DT NN .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ... [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP VBP DT NN CC PRP VBZ DT JJS NN PRP RB VBD :
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT JJS NN PRP RB VB IN `` DT JJS NN RB VBN , `` DT JJS NN PRP VBP RB VBD , NN IN `` DT JJS NN RB VBN . ``
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ? [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN VBZ , IN RB VBG IN NNS VBP DT NN IN PRP$ NN , CC RB VB PRP TO VB DT NN .
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN WRB VBZ PRP VB .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ NN .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT JJ NN VB NN IN DT NN .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN , VB TO VB .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen . [ pos tagging ] CC NN MD VB IN NN TO VB VB PRP VB .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ulti@@ mate respect for an audience . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP VBZ JJ , IN WRB NN RB VB PRP , PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS VB WRB JJ NNS VBP VBG TO VB TO PRP , RB .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ? [ pos tagging ] VBP PRP VB DT NN : JJ VBP POS VBP TO VB `` JJ `` IN DT VBZ DT JJ NN : CC VBP PRP VB WRB DT VBZ VBG TO VB RP .
how much money does it take to do this ? [ pos tagging ] WRB JJ NN VBZ PRP VB TO VB DT .
1.@@ 5 million . [ pos tagging ] CD CD .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP IN PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT JJ NN NN IN PRP , CC RB VBP PRP VBZ RB JJ VBG DT NN JJ , RB JJ NNS .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots . [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ , RB IN DT NN PRP$ NN VBZ RP , PRP VBP IN DT NN IN VBG NNS .
what do you think the response is going to be ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBP PRP VB DT NN VBZ VBG TO VB .
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT NNS RB MD VB `` DT . ``
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ? [ pos tagging ] CC VBZ PRP DT JJ NN IN IN DT NN CC DT JJ NN IN IN PRP .

when you look at the people you deal with .. [ pos tagging ] WRB PRP VBP IN DT NNS PRP VBP IN NN
we &apos;ve got some places we can go . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN DT NNS PRP MD VB .
turn the camera off . [ pos tagging ] VB DT NN RP .

turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot; [ pos tagging ] VBZ RP PRP RB VBZ , `` PRP VBP NN TO VB IN PRP$ NN . ``
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN DT , CD IN CD , DT IN DT NNS RB VBD .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie . [ pos tagging ] NN IN PRP VBD NN TO VB IN DT NN .
i was ama@@ zed . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD VBN .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB NN TO VB IN DT NN .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .

especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mas@@ ses ?

no , that &apos;s what i thought . [ pos tagging ] DT , DT VBZ WP JJ NN .

actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever . [ pos tagging ] RB DT , DT VBD RB DT NN NN .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP NNS VBP VBN DT NN IN DT .
this would have been fine . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB VBN JJ .
but what this image represents was the problem . [ pos tagging ] CC WP DT NN VBZ VBD DT NN .
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up . [ pos tagging ] NN , WRB PRP VBP DT NN NN NN IN NN , DT VBZ : : DT VBZ CD IN DT JJ NNS WDT VBZ RP .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ IN DT NN PRP VBP , JJ NN . DT .
this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility or acc@@ essi@@ bility of information , especially concern@@ ing business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .

you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , PRP VBP DT NN IN NN DT NNS .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NNS VBP PRP , PRP$ NN VBZ PRP , RB PRP$ NN POS VBP PRP .

it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ : IN DT JJ NN NN .

now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP , IN DT NN , PRP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN .
but with only one company , one agen@@ cy willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ baum for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .

so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conver@@ sa@@ tions with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP RB VBD TO VB : CC WP NN VBD TO VB : VBZ IN WRB PRP VBD VBG NNS IN DT NNS , DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NN VBZ DT JJ NN .

that &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent tour . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBP MD VB DT IN PRP$ NNS CC VB PRP DT JJ NN .
we are a smaller brand . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJR NN .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand . [ pos tagging ] JJ IN PRP VBD IN VBG DT JJR NN , PRP VBP RB RB DT NN NN .
so we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP '' VBP DT NNS IN JJ NNS VBP .
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it . [ pos tagging ] RB VBG NNS IN DT : PRP VBP , VBP NNS IN NN : VBZ NN IN WRB VBD JJ IN PRP .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ? [ pos tagging ] WDT VBP DT NNS IN PRP MD VB TO VB NN .
ban is blan@@ k . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ JJ .
that &apos;s a great question . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN .

we talk about b@@ old , fresh . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN NN , JJ .

what about me ? what about a regular guy ? [ pos tagging ] WP IN PRP . WP IN DT JJ NN .
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP TO VB NN TO DT NN IN DT NN , DT NNS WP VBP IN PRP , DT JJ NNS .

i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP DT NN IN JJ NNS , DT NN IN NNS CC NN IN DT .

if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z . [ pos tagging ] IN VBN VBD DT NN , PRP MD VB DT JJ JJ NNS NN .

there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there . [ pos tagging ] EX VBD DT JJ NN IN JJ VBG IN IN EX .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .

those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very ni@@ c@@ ely together . [ pos tagging ] DT VBP JJ RB RB RB .
and i think there &apos;s almost a parado@@ x with those . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP EX VBZ RB DT NN IN DT .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their streng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP DT NNS MD RB VB IN CD IN PRP$ NNS CC DT JJ RB IN VBG IN DT .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .

i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since laun@@ ch . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO RB VB IN DT NN CC RB VB PRP DT NN IN DT JJ NNS PRP VBP VBN IN NN .
so , simple : you come to goog@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com . [ pos tagging ] RB , NN : PRP VBP TO VB .
you look around at all these muse@@ ums here . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB IN PDT DT NNS RB .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN DT NN , PRP VBP VBN DT NN , DT NN , DT NN , DT NN NN .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO RB VB TO CD IN PRP$ NNS , DT JJ NN IN NN IN JJ NN .
two ways of going in -- very simple . [ pos tagging ] CD NNS IN VBG IN : RB JJ .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum . [ pos tagging ] NN CC , RB , PRP VBP IN DT NN .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ NN WRB PRP VBP : NN , NN , PRP VBZ '' RB NN .
you move around , you have fun . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB , PRP VBP VBN .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump . [ pos tagging ] VB DT NN RB , CC , IN CD NN , NN .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN RB , PRP VBP TO VB TO DT NN IN DT NN .
keep going . have fun . [ pos tagging ] VB VBG . VB NN .
explore . [ pos tagging ] RB .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part . [ pos tagging ] NNS . VB RB PRP VBP TO DT JJS NN .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met . [ pos tagging ] RB RB JJ VBP IN NN IN CD IN PRP$ JJ NNS , `` DT NNS `` IN NN NN IN DT NN .
i see this plus sign . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT CC NN .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN VBZ VBN PRP DT NN , PRP VBP IN PRP .
now this is one of the images . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ CD IN DT NNS .
so this is all of the meta@@ -@@ data information . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ DT IN DT JJ NN .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now . [ pos tagging ] IN DT IN PRP WP VBP RB JJ IN NN , PRP MD VB DT : CC JJ VBP VBG TO VB DT RP RB RB .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ CD IN DT NNS IN PRP VBD IN WP PRP VBP JJ NN .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN , IN NN , VBZ RB TO , JJ VBP , IN CD CD NNS .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP DT NN IN NNS VBG PRP : `` WP VBP PRP VB IN CD CD NNS . ``
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP VBG TO VB CC VB PRP WP PRP RB VB IN CD CD NNS .
you can zo@@ om around very simply . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB RP RB RB .
you see some fun stuff happening here . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN VBD VBG RB .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP DT NN : PRP$ NN VBZ JJ .
but then you really want to go deep . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP RB VB TO VB RB .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBD VBG RB , CC NN VBD NN VBG IN IN RB .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD IN , `` VB IN . IN VBZ JJ . ``
went in , and i started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something . [ pos tagging ] VBD IN , CC NN VBD VBG IN DT NNS VBD RB VBG NN .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a goo@@ se with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD DT JJ NN , VBD TO DT NN IN PRP$ NNS IN DT NN , CC RB VBN RP IN DT VBZ DT NN VBN NN , WDT VBZ VBG DT NN IN DT NN IN NN NN .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD RB JJ .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS VBP WRB PRP VBD PRP , CC NNS VBD NN IN PRP .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks . [ pos tagging ] RB RB TO VB RB JJ IN , PRP MD RB VB TO DT NNS .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get . [ pos tagging ] RB RB TO VB PRP DT VBP , JJ VBP VBG TO VB RP RB PRP RB VB WP PRP VBP .
here is where we were , and this is the painting . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ WRB PRP VBD , CC DT VBZ DT NN .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second . [ pos tagging ] DT JJS VBZ RB TO VB : RB IN DT JJ .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the mom@@ a , again in new york . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBP PRP RB RB NN IN DT NN , RB IN JJ NN .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN PRP$ NNS , `` DT NN NN . ``
now the example i showed you was all about finding details . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN NN VBD PRP VBD DT IN VBG NNS .
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP IN PRP VBP TO VB JJ NNS .
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP IN PRP VBP TO VB WRB JJ NN RB VBD DT NN .
you zo@@ om in . you really go in . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN . PRP RB VB IN .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB TO CD IN PRP$ JJ NNS IN DT NN , CC JJ VBP RB VBG TO VB TO DT NNS .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ `` DT NN NN , `` NN VBP , RB VBN IN DT NN .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB PRP PRP$ JJ JJ NN .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN RB , CC JJ VBP POS VBP NN .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ JJ NN . PRP VBZ VBN NNS .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter . [ pos tagging ] DT CD IN PRP , NN : JJ POS NN IN PRP VBP JJ , IN PRP VBP JJ , IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN : JJ JJ NN .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own colle@@ ction across all these images . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB CC VB PRP$ JJ NN NN : VB PRP$ JJ NN IN PDT DT NNS .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around . [ pos tagging ] RB RB , PRP VBP IN : CC JJ VBP VBN DT , VBD DT NN IN NN : PRP MD RB VB RP .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ aller@@ y . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ `` DT NNS , `` VBN IN DT JJ NN .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN , VB PRP TO PRP$ NNS CC RB VB DT NN VBG IN WP PRP VBP VBG WRB PRP VBP IN DT NNS .
so i think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP , IN NN , IN PRP , DT JJ NN VBZ IN PDT DT JJ NN RB VBZ RB RB VBN IN NN .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opini@@ on , even come from the muse@@ ums . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ CD , IN PRP$ NN , RB VBP IN DT NNS .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that . [ pos tagging ] NN RB JJ NNS VBP IN .
it really comes from these artists . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ IN DT NNS .
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ VBN PRP$ VBG NN IN DT .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP , JJ VBP IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP RB TO PRP$ NN CC VB PRP RB NN .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJS NN NN VBP VBN NNS VBZ , `` VBD PRP VB DT TO VB DT NN IN VBG TO DT NN . ``
and the answer is no . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ DT .
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ TO VB DT NN .
and that &apos;s it . thank you . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ PRP . VB PRP .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NN , CC PRP$ NN MD VB VBN IN CD NNS .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ NN , CC RB DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT JJ .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can p@@ lot our brain . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN PRP VBD DT NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN , RB PRP MD VB PRP$ NN .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , DT MD VB NN WP VBZ RB JJ .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intui@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB NN WP VBZ RB JJ .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB MD PRP VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN .
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time . [ pos tagging ] DT IN PRP MD VB VBN IN CD IN DT NNS , CC JJ VBP IN JJS NNS IN DT NN , PRP$ NN VBZ NN IN DT : IN DT JJ NN IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB IN PRP VBP RB JJ CC NN .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB JJ CC JJ .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of lo@@ gic to string together these complex ideas . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBP PRP CD IN DT NNS , IN IN JJS IN DT JJ JJ NN NNS , WP VBP DT JJ NN IN NN TO VBG RB DT JJ NNS .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN NN TO RB VB DT NNS NN .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff . [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP PRP VB DT NN . RB PRP VBP TO VB IN NN .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP RP CC VB IN PRP , CC RB PRP VBP WRB PRP VBZ , CC RB PRP VBP PRP$ NN IN RB .
and really you do the same thing . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN PRP MD VB VBN IN DT NNS VBZ IN CD NN VBZ RB IN CD NN IN DT NN .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , PRP MD VB JJ TO VB IN CD NN VBG IN CD JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBP '' VBN IN DT NN , PRP VBD PRP .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP VBG DT NN NN IN DT NN NN .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB DT NN CC PRP VBZ JJ RB JJ IN PRP , CC PRP VBD VBG RP .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBD VBG IN DT NN VB NN PRP DT RB JJ NN , CC DT VBZ DT JJ NNS VBP JJ NN PRP VB JJ IN PRP , CC IN PRP VBP IN CD NN .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT VBZ DT JJ JJ NN TO VB IN DT NN , IN PRP VBP DT NN NN .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with car st@@ ops , they play with these little weird particles . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN , IN PRP VBP JJ NN IN NN NNS , PRP VBP IN DT JJ JJ NNS .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBP IN PRP$ NNS , PRP VBP PRP VBP DT NNS IN RB JJ NNS : IN PRP MD VB RB IN NNS , CC PRP MD VB IN CD JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD RB PDT DT NNS , CC PRP VBD PRP DT NN IN NN NNS .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN VBZ WRB NN VBD IN DT JJ NNS RB : PRP VBD NN NNS TO VB JJ , JJ NNS .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP '' VBP PRP TO VB DT JJ , JJ NNS IN PRP .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ RB VBN RB IN PRP$ NN , CC RB PRP VBZ RB IN JJ VBP POS NN IN NNS RB RB .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ VBP IN PRP RB , CC RB RB RB .
and i &apos;ve never seen them . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP RB VBN PRP .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , NN POS RB VBN DT NN .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logi@@ cal side either . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ JJ NN RB IN PRP$ JJ NN DT .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ? [ pos tagging ] IN IN NN VBZ VBN IN IN JJ NNS CC PDT DT JJ NNS VBP NN NNS , RB VB CD NN RB VB NN NNS .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS VBP DT NN WRB PRP VBD PRP .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB DT NN RBR IN DT JJ NN IN PRP MD VB VB IN DT JJ NN RB VBZ NN NNS .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NNS RB , NN VBD RP TO VB RB DT .
so i made one . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD CD .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical quant@@ um super@@ position . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP MD VB DT VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN NN .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBP VBG IN RB VBZ DT JJ NN NN .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB IN NN DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN IN NN NN VBP VBG TO VB VBG IN IN DT NN .
this is a photograph of the object . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB IN DT JJ NN . PRP VBP VBG RB RB IN DT NN .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal . [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB VBZ DT RB , RB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBP VBG IN VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN , CC PRP VBZ VBN IN DT VBG NN , CC PRP VBZ VBG RP IN DT NN .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBD DT NN IN RB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP DT NN NN .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBD IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NN , CC RB VB RB VBN RP IN PDT DT JJ NNS IN RB CD NNS .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swi@@ mming po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped hole underneath the device . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN , NN VBD TO VB PRP$ JJ NN : TO VB DT VBG JJ NN IN DT NN .
this device has the ability to be in a quant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ DT NN TO VB IN DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB PRP .
here , let me give you an analog@@ y . [ pos tagging ] RB , VB PRP VB PRP DT NN .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ? [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP WRB JJ PRP VBZ TO VB IN DT JJ NN .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , WRB NN VBP IN DT NN DT RB , NNS VBP DT NNS IN JJ NNS , CC RB JJ NNS VBP IN NN CC VB VBP VBG DT NNS IN JJ VBP POS VBP TO VB PRP , CC , RB , VB PRP .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anima@@ te objects feel the same way . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NNS VBZ IN NN NNS VBP DT JJ NN .
the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ anima@@ te objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS IN JJ NNS VBP RB RB NNS , CC PRP VBZ RB DT JJ VBG IN PRP CC DT NN NN IN PRP CC DT NN IN DT NN .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD , IN PRP VBD TO VB DT NN IN NN VBP NN RB , PRP VBP VBG TO VB TO VB RP PDT DT JJ NNS .
and so that &apos;s what we did . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT VBZ WP PRP VBD .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RP DT NNS , CC RB PRP VBP PRP IN DT NN CC VBD RP PDT DT NN , CC RB PRP VBD PRP RP RB , DT RB IN DT NN , DT JJ NN IN NN VBZ JJ TO VB RB PRP VBD .
and so we measu@@ red its motion . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD PRP$ NN .
we found it was moving in really weird ways . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP VBD VBG IN RB JJ NNS .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws . [ pos tagging ] RB IN RB VBG RB RB , PRP VBD VBG , CC DT NN PRP VBD VBG VBD VBG NN IN DT : IN VBG CC VBG NNS .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] CC IN VBG PRP DT JJ NN , PRP VBD JJ TO VB PRP DT NN CC RB VB IN DT JJ NN : NN WDT VBZ RB VBN IN JJ NNS .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic . [ pos tagging ] IN WP JJ VBP VBG PRP RB VBZ NN RB JJ .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ PRP VB IN CD NN TO VB DT VBG CC RB VBG IN DT JJ NN .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms . [ pos tagging ] RB VB POS VB IN DT NNS .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down . [ pos tagging ] RB IN CD NN : PDT DT NNS IN NNS WDT VBP RP DT NN IN NN VBP VBG RB CC IN DT JJ NN DT JJ NNS VBP VBG RB CC RB .
now it &apos;s only at pre@@ cise times when they al@@ ig@@ n . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ RB IN JJ NNS WRB PRP VBP .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBP VBN .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT NN VBZ IN CD JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN , WDT IN NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN VBZ IN CD JJ NNS .
i think this is really cool . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP DT VBZ RB JJ .
really . [ pos tagging ] RB .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ VBG PRP IN DT JJ NN TO VB DT IN PDT DT NNS RB , VB DT RP , DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN CC IN NN IN NN VBZ IN DT JJ IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN CC PRP .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ? [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT JJ NN MD VB IN CD JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN , IN NN IN NN MD VB IN CD JJ NNS , RB WRB RB PRP .
i mean , this is just my logi@@ cal side talking . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN , DT VBZ RB PRP$ JJ NN VBG .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ? [ pos tagging ] RB JJ IN PRP VBP IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN , WP MD RB VB IN .
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ? [ pos tagging ] WRB MD PRP$ NN VB PRP$ NN VBG VBN IN NN .
there &apos;s one more part to the story . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ CD JJR NN TO DT NN .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ WRB PRP VBD PRP RP , CC PRP VBD IN DT NNS CC VBD IN DT NN , PRP VBD IN DT NN NN VBD RB RB IN CD NN .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into a tiny space . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBD TO VB DT JJ NN , IN PRP VBZ IN PDT DT NNS IN DT NN VBP RB RB JJ NNS RB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN IN NN IN WRB JJ NNS VBZ IN NN VBZ DT JJ .
well , that &apos;s not quite right . [ pos tagging ] RB , DT VBZ RB RB JJ .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJR IN DT : PRP VBZ JJR .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN DT NNS , PRP$ NNS TO PDT DT NNS IN PRP , RB VB WP PRP VBP , CC DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN NNS .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development . [ pos tagging ] IN CD , NN VBD IN PRP VBD TO VB WRB PRP VBD IN JJ NN .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ JJ NN MD VB IN WRB DT NN VBZ IN WRB PRP VBP TO VB CC VB , PRP MD VB JJ TO VB IN IN JJS DT NN IN JJ NNS WDT VBD DT VBG TO VB JJ NNS .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN RB IN DT NN RB RB .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP NNS IN NNS IN VBG NNS WP VBP NNS VBP RB DT JJ NN WDT MD VB JJ TO VB PRP .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN IN NNS VBZ PRP VBP IN RB RB JJR IN PRP VBZ TO VB PRP .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN NNS , RB NNS , IN JJ NNS .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities . [ pos tagging ] RB DT MD VB JJ TO PRP IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN JJ NNS .
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute a@@ partment building for cities . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ NN NN IN NNS .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet . [ pos tagging ] NN PDT DT NNS WP VBD TO VB IN NNS RB VBD PRP : DT JJ NN JJ POS EX RB .

so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB DT IN DT NNS .

through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essen@@ ti@@ als . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN NN , NN CC NN , DT NN IN JJ NN , RB VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN NN NN RB TO DT NN NNS .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the exi@@ sting a@@ partment hol@@ ders . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBD DT NN IN NNS , IN DT NNS WDT VBP PRP MD VB VB IN CC VB PDT DT VBG NN NNS .

in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN CD , DT NN IN JJ VBN RP DT NN TO DT NN .
he showed it to ja@@ vier . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP TO VB .
they called me . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD , `` VB POS JJ DT TO DT NNS IN PRP$ NN . ``
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN PRP VBD IN NN , IN DT NN NN NN .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD TO VB DT NN IN WRB JJ NNS VBP , WRB RB RBR JJ PRP VBP IN PRP VBP .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBN DT NN VBG WRB JJ DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN IN JJ NN NN : NN , VBP DT VBZ JJ NNS IN NNS , IN DT NNS , IN JJ NN .

so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .

the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT NN VBD RB JJ CC JJ .

i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot; [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN PRP RB IN PRP$ NN . ``
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBD RB , CC PRP VBD DT NN .
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD TO DT NN , WDT VBZ IN DT JJ NN MD VB JJ NNS IN NNS .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north . [ pos tagging ] EX MD VB DT NN IN DT NN WDT PRP MD VB TO WDT MD VB IN NNS , RB IN NNS IN NNS RB IN DT NN .
and it also involved new choices for leaders . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBD JJ NNS IN NNS .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .

and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .

and he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with c@@ ameras ready usually . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD TO DT NNS IN NNS WDT MD VB RP JJ , IN NNS JJ RB .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked ja@@ m for our experiment . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBD NN IN PRP$ NN .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le . [ pos tagging ] RB POS PRP$ NN NN .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of ja@@ m . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD CD JJ NNS IN NN .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RP DT JJ VBG RB RB IN DT NN IN DT NN .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sam@@ ple some ja@@ m ? [ pos tagging ] PRP EX VBN RP CD JJ NNS IN NN CC CD JJ NNS IN NN , CC PRP VBD IN CD NNS : RB , IN WDT NN VBD NNS RBR JJ TO VB , VB DT NN .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent . [ pos tagging ] RBR NNS VBD WRB EX VBD CD , RB CD NN , IN WRB EX VBD CD , RB CD NN .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN PRP VBD IN VBZ IN WDT NN VBD NNS RBR JJ TO VB DT NN IN NN .
now we see the opposite effect . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS WP VBD WRB EX VBD CD , RB CD NN IN PRP RB VBD DT NN IN NN .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS WP VBD WRB EX VBD CD , RB RB PRP VBD IN CD NN IN PRP RB VBD DT NN IN NN .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP DT NN , NNS VBD IN JJS CD NNS RBR JJ TO VB DT NN IN NN IN PRP VBD CD IN IN PRP VBD CD .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .

so now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sav@@ ings . [ pos tagging ] RB RB IN DT NN IN NN : JJ NNS .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.@@ s . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP VBG TO VB TO PRP DT NN NN VBD IN NN NN , NN NN , NN NN WRB PRP VBD IN DT NN NNS NNS IN RB DT CD NNS IN IN CD NNS DT IN DT NN .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBD IN VBD IN DT NN IN NN NNS JJ IN DT NN NN NN , DT CD NN , VBZ IN VB NNS POS NN TO VB JJR IN NN .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBD VBD IN RB EX VBD DT NN .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NNS , PRP VBD IN CD NNS WDT VBD IN VBG NNS RB IN CD TO CD JJ NN NNS .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBD VBD IN , DT JJR NNS VBN , RB , EX VBD JJR NN NN .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP IN DT NNS , DT NNS WDT VBD PRP CD NNS , NN NNS VBD RB IN DT NNS : RB RB RB JJ IN PRP VBP PRP TO VB .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS WDT VBD RB CD NNS , NN NNS VBP RB VBN TO IN DT JJ NN .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participa@@ te when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ RP IN RB IN PRP VBP VB TO VB WRB EX VBP JJR NNS JJ , RB RB , PRP VBZ JJ NNS .
so for those people who did choose to participa@@ te , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NNS WP VBD VB TO VB , DT JJR NNS JJ , DT RBR JJ NNS VBD TO RB VB NNS CC NN NNS .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts . [ pos tagging ] DT JJR NNS JJ , DT RBR JJ PRP VBD TO VB DT PRP$ NN IN JJ NN NN NNS .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ com@@ men@@ d for people when you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .

the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning display .

so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses . [ pos tagging ] IN WP NN VBP TO VB TO PRP NN VBP CD JJ NNS : NNS IN PRP VBP VBN IN CD NN CC DT IN JJ NN NNS : IN PRP MD RB VB IN PRP$ NNS .
the first : cut . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ : NN .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN PRP VBD IN , CC PRP VBZ RB VBN JJR JJ IN NN , IN JJR VBZ RBR .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot; [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP RB VBN WRB NNS VBP , `` NN . ``
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB JJ PRP VBP VBG TO VB NN NN .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant op@@ tions , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .

when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent . [ pos tagging ] WRB NN CC NN : CC : JJ VBD IN CD JJ NNS IN NN CC NN : CC : NNS TO CD , PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS IN CD NN .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling c@@ at li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs . [ pos tagging ] WRB DT JJ NN NN VBD JJ IN PRP$ CD JJ NN NN NNS , PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS IN CD NN : DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS CC NN IN NNS .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , DT JJ NN NN NN VBZ PRP CD NNS .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today off@@ ers you 100,000 products . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN VBZ PRP CD NNS .
but the nin@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the nin@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce .

now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ ib@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .

every single harvard employe@@ e is now auto@@ matically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle fund . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NN VBZ RB RB VBN IN DT NN NN .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS WP RB VBP TO VB , PRP VBP VBN CD NNS , RB CD CC JJR NNS .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP , RB , NNS VBP , `` JJ VBP POS VB WRB TO VB .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NNS . ``
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN NN VBP VBZ VB VBP DT NNS , `` VB PRP WRB DT NNS VBP JJ IN CD DT .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP$ NNS MD VB VB PRP RB , CC MD PRP$ NNS . ``
now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ noon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBD PRP$ NN DT NN , NN VBD DT NN IN NN .

here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
and i &apos;d like you to read it . [ pos tagging ] CC VB MD VB PRP TO VB PRP .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his offer . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ MD VB PRP DT JJ NNS TO VB PRP CC RB VB VBP PRP TO VB PRP$ NNS IN PRP VBP JJ TO VB JJ RP IN PRP$ NN .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer . [ pos tagging ] NN . NN WP VBZ JJ TO VB PRP RP IN PRP$ NN .
is that all ? [ pos tagging ] VBZ IN DT .
all right , let me show you some more about this . [ pos tagging ] DT NN , VB PRP VB PRP DT RBR IN DT .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VB EX VBD DT NN , VB POS PRP .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip . [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBZ JJ TO VB IN DT NN .
i think i might have actually heard more hands . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP NN MD VB RB VBN JJR NNS .
all right . [ pos tagging ] DT NN .
now in fact , you had obje@@ c@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would vent@@ ure to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , PRP VBD RB RBR NN DT JJ NN IN IN DT JJ NN IN , CC RB MD NN TO VB IN PRP VBD IN PRP VBD RBR JJ DT JJ NN IN .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS VBD PRP VB RBR JJ TO PRP .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation . [ pos tagging ] WDT VBZ PRP TO DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NN NN NN , WDT VBZ NN .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way . [ pos tagging ] DT IN NN IN NNS TO VB DT NNS IN DT NNS , PRP VBP TO VB JJ TO VB DT NNS VBN IN DT NN , CC IN DT NNS VBP TO VB VBN IN DT JJ NN IN NN , IN DT RB JJ NN .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ? [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP NNS VB DT NN IN CD TO CD NN JJR WRB PRP VBP DT JJ NN CC DT NN NN IN VBN TO NN .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ '' NN IN JJ NN .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RP IN VBG PRP VB RBR JJ MD RB VB DT RB JJ NN TO VB IN VBG NNS TO VB JJR .
so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN NN VBD IN NN NN CC NN NN , PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS IN VBG : NNS WDT VBP DT VBG IN VBG : CC RB DT NNS VBD DT IN DT NN WRB PRP VBP VBG NN IN PRP$ CD NN .
and during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , PRP VBD DT NN RB DT NN PRP VBD TO VB , CC PRP VBD CD JJ NN .
the one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more . [ pos tagging ] DT CD JJ NN PRP VBD VBD PRP VBD NNS TO RB VB IN PDT DT JJ NNS WDT MD VB IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBD RBR .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent . [ pos tagging ] IN VBG IN JJ NN , EX VBD DT NN IN NN IN CD NN CC EX VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS JJ TO VB CC DT NN IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB RP IN PRP$ NNS VBP IN CD NN .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN : NN .
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB JJR NNS IN PRP MD VB NNS .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , RB VBZ DT NN PRP VBD IN DT NN NN .
it turns out that in weg@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RP IN IN NNS NN NNS IN CC IN DT NN NN , DT NN VBZ VBP RB IN CD JJ NNS IN NNS PDT DT NN IN TO CD .
but you know what ? [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP WP .
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBP PRP CD NNS CC JJ VBP PRP RP IN CD NNS , NN NN VBP PRP CD NNS CC VB PRP RP IN CD NNS , PRP VBP IN NN VBP VBN PRP JJR NN CC DT JJR NN NN IN NNS VBD PRP DT CD IN IN JJ VBD PRP DT CD .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS VBP PRP WRB TO VB PRP RB .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP CD JJ NN NNS .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CD VBZ VBN `` NN `` CC DT JJ NN VBZ VBN `` NN . ``
if you think the display on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right is ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN VBZ VBG CC DT NN IN DT NN VBZ NN , VB PRP$ NNS .
okay , there &apos;s some . [ pos tagging ] NN , EX VBZ DT .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN VBZ NN CC DT NN IN DT NN VBZ VBG , VB PRP$ NNS .
okay , a bit more . [ pos tagging ] NN , DT NN RBR .
now it turns out you &apos;re right . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ RP PRP VBP JJ .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ? [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN DT NN VBZ NN CC DT NN IN DT NN VBZ VBG , CC PRP VBP WP .
this is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT RB JJ NN NN .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP TO VB NN TO DT NN , RB DT NN .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VBP DT NN WRB PRP VBZ RB TO DT JJ NNS IN PDT DT NNS .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBP PRP RB VBD TO VB VBG .
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ JJ NN : NN IN NN .
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RP PRP MD RB VB DT NN JJR NN IN PRP VBP PRP MD , PRP VBP RB VBN TO VB PRP DT JJ JJR .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO RB VB DT NN .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB PRP CD NN IN WP JJ VBP VBG IN .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car . [ pos tagging ] NN POS VB DT RB , RB JJ NN : NN DT NN .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ PRP DT NN TO RB VB VB PRP$ NN .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN TO VB CD JJ NNS , RB VB RP PRP$ NN .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NNS VBP IN DT NN IN NNS IN PRP VBP IN NN .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices . [ pos tagging ] NN NNS , JJ NN NNS : JJ VBP VBN CD NNS .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices . [ pos tagging ] NNS , NN : CD NNS .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear . [ pos tagging ] RB RB WP NN VBP VBG TO VB VBZ VB VBP VBG TO VB DT NN IN WDT DT NNS VBP .
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts . [ pos tagging ] RB NN IN DT NNS VBP VBG TO VB IN JJ NN , CD NN NNS , TO JJ NN , CD NNS .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN DT NNS VBP VBG TO VB IN JJ NN , CD NNS , TO CD NN NNS , JJ NN .
what am i going to look at ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBP JJ VBG TO VB IN .
how enga@@ ged you are . [ pos tagging ] WRB VBN PRP VBP .
if you keep hit@@ ting the de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP VBG DT NN NN IN NN , DT VBZ PRP VBP VBG VBD , IN VBZ JJ VBP VBG PRP .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on over and over and over again . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBP VBZ DT NNS WP VBP IN JJ NN TO JJ NN , PRP VBP VBG IN NN NN IN CC IN CC RB RB .
we &apos;re losing them . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG PRP .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN JJ NN TO JJ NN , PRP VBP VBG IN RB .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN . PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNS .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN NN VBP VBN VBZ VBN VBP VBN DT NN IN WDT DT NN VBZ VBN .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBP PRP IN JJ , VB VBP WRB TO VB .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG NN NN POS VB PRP NN IN PRP$ NNS IN JJ NN , PRP RB VBZ PRP IN WRB TO VB .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN IN JJ VBP VBG RB , IN JJ VBP RBR JJ TO VB VBN TO VB VBN .
so let me rec@@ ap . [ pos tagging ] RB VB PRP VB .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP VBN IN CD NNS IN VBG DT NN IN NN NN : NN : VB JJ IN DT JJ NNS : VB : VB PRP JJ : VB : PRP MD VB JJR NNS , JJR NNS : NN IN NN .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving . [ pos tagging ] DT IN DT NNS IN VBP VBP VBG TO PRP NN VBP VBN TO VB PRP VB PRP$ NNS : JJR IN PRP , PRP MD VB PRP IN PRP , JJR IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP VBG .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBP IN DT NN TO VBG DT RBS IN NN VBZ TO VB JJ IN VBG .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing . [ pos tagging ] CC DT RBR PRP VBP JJ TO VB JJ IN VBG DT JJR PRP MD VB JJ TO NN DT NN IN NN .

but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBZ NN VBZ VBN PRP RB IN DT IN PRP CC DT IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBP MD VB RB JJ IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN POS NN .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day . [ pos tagging ] DT CD IN PRP MD VB JJ IN DT NN IN JJ NN .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded to youtube every minute . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP IN CD NNS IN NN VBN TO VB DT NN .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT , RB DT JJ NN RB VBZ JJ CC VBZ NNS IN NNS CC VBZ DT JJ NN .
so how does it happen ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB VBZ PRP VB .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of participa@@ tion and un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness . [ pos tagging ] CD NNS : NNS , NNS IN NN CC NN .

but combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist . [ pos tagging ] CC VBN IN DT JJ NN , PRP MD VB NN WDT RB VBZ JJ , IN PRP MD VB .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBP PRP MD VB .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP PRP$ NNS , IN PRP$ NN RB JJ CD IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ '' RB VB NN .
and i see the same process with combin@@ ing photographs . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP DT JJ NN IN VBG NN .
it &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB RB IN VBG JJ NNS .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NNS WDT VBP DT NN NN JJ , JJ VBP PRP VBZ DT NNS IN PRP VBP '' RB VBP IN , DT NNS DT IN PRP IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
but when combin@@ ing photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB VBG RB , DT VBZ RB JJ TO VB , IN IN PRP RB VBZ JJ RB .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result . [ pos tagging ] RB RB MD VB TO VB IN EX VBP CD JJ NNS TO VB TO VB DT JJ NN .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB , DT NNS VBP POS RB JJ .
but combin@@ ed , they can create something like this . [ pos tagging ] CC VBN , PRP MD VB NN IN DT .
so the first rule is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN VBZ IN NNS VBN MD VB DT JJ NN .
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light . [ pos tagging ] RB , NNS VBN MD VB DT JJ NN IN NN .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light . [ pos tagging ] CC DT CD NNS DT VBP DT CD NNS : NN IN DT JJ NN CC IN DT JJ NN IN NN .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ CD VBZ IN VBG PRP JJ TO VB WRB DT JJ NNS VBP CC VBP IN VBG PRP JJ .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed . [ pos tagging ] VB PRP JJ TO VB WRB DT NN RB VBD VBN .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG NN , NN CC NN IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NNS , VBG JJ NNS IN NN IN NN , VBD NNS CC NN , PRP VBP DT NNS IN DT JJ NNS CC VB PRP VB IN CD JJ NN , IN DT NN IN CD NN MD VB NNS IN NNS RB .
so here &apos;s another example . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBZ DT NN .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated . [ pos tagging ] CD MD VB IN DT VBZ RB DT NN IN DT NN CC DT JJR NN VBZ WP VBZ VBN .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ RB RB VBN IN NN IN JJ NNS .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head . [ pos tagging ] NN RB VBP IN PRP VBZ JJR TO RB VB DT NN IN TO VB DT NN , IN RB PRP VBP '' VBP TO VB IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NN .
but it does require a lot of planning . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ VB DT NN IN NN .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically . [ pos tagging ] CC VBG DT NN IN NN , VB VBD IN NN VBD JJ NNS TO VB PRP , TO VB DT JJ NNS IN DT NNS IN DT NN RB .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , DT NN VBD VBN IN DT NN NN .
the shor@@ es are from a different location . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP IN DT JJ NN .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBD VBN IN DT NN NN .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h . [ pos tagging ] CC UH , JJ RB VBD DT NN IN NN IN DT NN VBD TO VB PRP VB RBR JJ .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to planning . [ pos tagging ] RB TO VB DT JJ NN , NN VBP PRP VBZ RB TO NN .
it always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBZ IN DT NN , DT NN .
then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photographs . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBZ IN VBG DT JJ NN .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN VBZ RB RB VBN .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN VBG DT NN , DT NN MD VB RB JJ CC RB RB JJ .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination . [ pos tagging ] RB PDT DT NNS VBP IN RB , CC DT JJ NN IN VBZ PRP VBZ PRP$ NN .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB TO VB TO PRP IN WRB JJ NN NNS VBP .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients . [ pos tagging ] CC VB RB VBP IN DT RBS JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN PRP VBD VBG TO NNS .
and one of the things we did at rad@@ b@@ oud university is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a ch@@ ie@@ f listening off@@ ic@@ er . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN DT NNS PRP VBD IN NN NN VBZ PRP VBD DT JJ JJ NN .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ? [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT RB JJ NN : PRP VBZ RP DT JJ NN IN NN CC NN IN NN CC VBZ NNS , NN , VBZ , `` WP VBZ RP .
how could we help you ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] WRB MD PRP VB PRP . ``
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP , PRP VBP TO VB , IN DT VBZ CD IN DT JJ NNS WRB DT : RB RB DT : CC JJS IN DT JJ NNS VBP , IN PRP VBD VBG .
this is my wi@@ f@@ i scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ PRP$ JJ NN . PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBD CD NN , IN NNP RP .
and every morning i ho@@ p on it . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN NN NN IN PRP .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see . [ pos tagging ] CC UH , JJ VBP VBN DT NN , IN PRP MD VB .
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBP PRP$ NN IN CD NN .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ VBN DT JJ IN WRB JJ NN IN , PRP VBZ PRP$ NNS IN NN NN RB RB .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN RB , IN PRP MD VB WP VBZ PRP$ NN IN NN , RB IN DT RB NN IN JJ VBP JJ NN CC NN IN PRP , CC RB VBG RB .
but there &apos;s another thing . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ DT NN .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter . [ pos tagging ] IN DT IN PRP MD VB , VB VBP VBN JJR IN CD NNS IN NN .
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ f@@ i scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN NN NN IN PRP$ JJ NN CC IN JJ VBP IN PRP$ NN , NNS VBP VBG TO PRP , `` NN VBP PRP VBP DT JJ NN NN , NN . ``
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT JJ NN WDT MD VB , IN DT VBZ JJ NN , NN NN VBN TO VB NNS : IN DT MD VB VBN IN NN , PRP MD VB VBN TO VB NN IN NNS .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ NN , PRP RB MD VB VBN TO VB NNS IN IN IN PRP$ NNS CC VB TO VB RB IN DT NN IN VBG NN TO VB JJR NN IN PRP$ NN .
as of next week , it will soon be available . [ pos tagging ] IN IN JJ NN , PRP MD RB VB JJ .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other . [ pos tagging ] EX MD VB DT JJ NN NN NN VBN TO DT NN CC NN CC JJ .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars . [ pos tagging ] CC NNS MD VB JJ , IN PRP$ NNS , TO VB PRP$ NN NN , VB PRP IN PRP$ NN CC RB NN PRP IN NNS , IN NN , IN IN DT JJ NNS .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like that .

make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team . [ pos tagging ] VB NNS WDT VBP JJ TO VB CC VB IN DT TO VB NNS IN DT NN .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB DT IN NNS IN DT , CC RB IN NN .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN DT NNS PRP VBD VB MD VB TO NN IN PRP VBN IN DT JJ NN .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT VBD NN NNS IN PRP$ NN .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB RB CC # CD : VBP CC # CD : PRP IN PRP$ NN .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB WRB PDT DT NN VBP IN DT NN IN NN .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ PRP VBP WRB PDT DT NN NNS VBP .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ , PRP MD VB JJ NN NNS .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ? [ pos tagging ] CC WRB MD VB DT JJS NN TO VB DT NN .
we asked around and nobody knew . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN CC NN NNS .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ tain@@ ed right now . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD WRB DT JJS JJ NN VBD TO VB VBN RB RB .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBD , PRP VBD DT NNS .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .

and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted . [ pos tagging ] CC IN CD NNS RB IN DT NNS RB VBP VBN VBN .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBD TO VB DT NNS IN PRP .
and we built an i@@ pad app@@ lic@@ ation . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT JJ NN .
we made an app@@ lic@@ ation for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN NN , VBN NN , TO VB DT NNS .
and whenever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed which can save lives . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN CC NN NNS , PRP MD VB PRP$ NN , CC IN DT JJ NNS RB VBP PRP$ JJ NN , TO VB DT JJS NN WDT MD VB NNS .

today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies . [ pos tagging ] NN VB VBP VBG TO VB IN JJ NNS .
now i work in the solar technology industry . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NN .

okay . thank you very much . [ pos tagging ] NN . NN PRP RB RB .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN NNS IN NN VBD DT NN TO VB TO VB DT NN NN CC NN NNS TO VB DT NN RB CC NN IN DT CD NN WDT VBZ RB JJ NN PRP VBP VBN TO VB : PRP VBP PRP NN IN NN .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBN NN IN NN , CC PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN IN NNS .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT JJ NNS DT NN CC PRP VBP PRP NN IN NN NNS .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG PRP RP IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBP PRP IN DT NNS IN NN NN .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers . [ pos tagging ] CC EX PRP VBP JJ NN , PRP VBP IN NN NNS .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WP PRP VBP VBG VBZ PRP VBP VBG WP VBZ JJ IN NN NN .
so meet al . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NN .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ DT NN NN IN DT NN IN NN .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .

now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB VBD PRP VB TO VB VBG IN NN IN DT RB JJ NN .
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS IN NN JJ NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in febru@@ ary last year . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB IN JJ , CC PRP VBD DT NN IN JJ JJ NN .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD IN DT NN RB VBZ TO VBG RP DT NN NNS .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named er@@ ik micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things . [ pos tagging ] CC CD NN IN JJ , DT NN VBN JJ NN , VBD NN RB , CC DT VBZ IN NNS VBP VBG RP NNS RB IN NN IN DT NNS .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBD WP DT JJ NN MD VB , PRP VBD DT NN .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN WRB PRP MD VB DT NN NN .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP TO VB PRP RP WRB PRP VBZ .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP , PRP VBP TO VB PRP , CC PRP VBD DT JJ CD NN .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP '' , NN MD VB PRP IN PRP .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynam@@ ics on it . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ VBD JJ JJ NN NNS IN PRP .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ JJ NN .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB DT JJS IN DT CD NN IN DT NNS VBD JJ NN .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ VBG NN IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBG RB .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN DT NN . NN IN DT NN IN NN WP VBD DT NN CC VBD IN PRP MD VB PRP , RB IN NN , CC TO VB NNS TO VB NN NNS .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN NNS NN , CC NNS VBP DT NNS IN IN PRP .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ VBG NNS TO VB IN PRP .
and then se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ ins . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VB VBD TO VB PRP TO VB NNS TO VB RP VBN NN NNS .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws . [ pos tagging ] CC VB RB VBN PRP RP TO VB NNS TO VB RP TO VB NNS WRB PRP VBZ .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP RB VBP IN CD NNS WDT VBP VBG TO VB DT .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ VBN RB RB , RB , RB .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP NN IN NN NN , PRP VBP IN DT NN VBZ WRB PRP RB VBZ .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years . [ pos tagging ] VBG NN RB VBZ DT NN IN NNS .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN WDT VBD IN DT NN IN NN JJ NN IN VBD CD NNS IN CD CC DT JJ NNS .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS MD VB RP WDT VBD DT JJ JJ NNS IN PRP$ NNS .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN RB IN IN DT VBD VBN IN JJ NNS , PRP MD VB VBN IN JJS CD NNS CC PRP MD VB VBN IN CD CD NNS .
and that &apos;s nothing . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ NN .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ CD NN IN DT NN NN NN RB RB IN RB RB NN NNS CD CD NNS , CC PRP VBZ JJ NN .
and there are projects like this at every level of government . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP NNS IN DT IN DT NN IN NN .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institution of government . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN WDT VBZ DT NN IN NNS TO VB CC RB NNS RB , DT VBZ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN TO DT NN IN NN .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ WRB NN MD VB RB : RB RBR IN DT JJ NN , IN JJ NNS VBP PRP MD .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself . [ pos tagging ] CC RB RB IN DT JJ NN , CC RBR IN DT NN PRP .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ NN , PRP VBZ JJ , PRP VBZ JJ .
and that &apos;s important . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ JJ .
but what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is tac@@ kl@@ ing the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ JJR JJ IN DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ WRB DT JJ NN VBZ VBG DT NN IN NN : RB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , CC IN DT NN IN JJ NN .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ JJ NN , IN , PRP VBZ RP , PRP VBP RB JJ IN JJ NN IN JJ NN .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively . [ pos tagging ] RB EX VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN NNS WDT VBP VBG DT NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS RB RB .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing ci@@ vi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB RB VB IN NN NNS , EX VBP NNS IN NNS DT IN DT NN WDT VBP VBG CC VBG JJ JJ DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
they haven &apos;t given up on government . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP POS VBN RP IN NN .
they are fru@@ strated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN IN NN IN PRP , CC PRP VBP RB VBG IN PRP , PRP VBP VBG PRP .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS VBP NN IN PRP VBP VBN NN IN .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ IN WRB PRP VBP RB DT PRP$ NNS IN NNS CC DT NN IN DT NN CC PDT DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBP RB JJ IN , NN VBZ , IN PRP$ NN , IN DT NNS IN NN NN RB , `` WP PRP VBP RB IN PRP MD VB VB RB . ``
now a lot of people have given up on government . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN NNS VBP VBN RP IN NN .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP CD IN DT NNS , NN MD VB IN PRP VBP , IN NNS VBP VBG .
politics is not changing ; government is changing . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBZ RB VBG : NN VBZ VBG .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN RB VBZ PRP$ NN IN PRP : VB `` PRP DT NNS . `` : WRB PRP VBP IN PRP VBZ VBG TO NN WRB DT NN VBZ .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP '' VB RB JJ IN NN WRB NN VBD DT NN .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people ele@@ cted to office . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN IN NNS , JJ VBD NN VBD RB IN VBG NNS VBN TO NN .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms . [ pos tagging ] RB IN CD NNS , RB VBP VBN TO DT NN IN , RB JJ NN , VBZ IN NNS .
this is the call center for the services and information line . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN NN IN DT NNS CC NN NN .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB WRB PRP MD VB IN PRP VBP CD IN PRP$ NN .
if you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD RB VB DT NN TO NN PRP$ NN POS NN NN , IN PRP$ JJ NN NN VBD IN NN IN DT NN : IN NN , PRP DT VBP DT : PRP MD VB IN NNS JJ NN IN DT RB JJ NN IN NNS , VBG VBG DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
so scot@@ t gets this call . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBZ DT NN .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ `` JJ `` IN DT JJ NN NN .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ CC RB VB RP IN NN . PRP VBZ IN JJ NN .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBZ , `` NN , MD PRP RB VB PDT DT NNS TO PRP$ NN CC NN NN RB JJ CC VB IN DT NN VBZ . ``
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBD . RB JJ IN NN .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ VBZ DT NN IN DT NNS .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center . [ pos tagging ] NN NN POS RB VB DT NN NN .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN , DT NN CC JJ NN , VBN NNS NN .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP '' VB DT NN .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN DT RB JJ NNS IN DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS IN NN .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ as@@ h@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead . [ pos tagging ] RB CD NN : DT VBZ DT JJ NN : DT VBD IN : `` NN IN PRP$ JJ . MD VB VB IN PRP VBZ JJ .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] WRB VBP VB VB DT VBN . ``
but what happens with citizens connect is different . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ IN NNS VBP VBZ JJ .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBD VBG NN .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NNS JJ NN VBZ JJ , IN NN MD VB DT .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , DT NN VBD PRP .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ as@@ h@@ can behind the house . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBD , `` NN VBD IN TO DT NN , VBD DT JJ IN DT NN .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? ye@@ p . [ pos tagging ] NN . NN . NN . UH .
turned tr@@ as@@ h@@ can on its side . walked home . [ pos tagging ] JJ JJ IN PRP$ NN . VBD NN .
go@@ od@@ night swe@@ et o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot; [ pos tagging ] JJ JJ NN . ``
pretty simple . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ JJ . DT VBZ DT JJ NN DT NN .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN NN VBG IN IN DT JJ NN .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technologi@@ cal definition of platform here . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ NN POS JJ RB DT JJ NN IN NN RB .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP RB VBG IN DT NN IN NNS TO VB PRP CC TO VB NNS .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here . [ pos tagging ] RB CD NN VBD DT NN , CC NN VBD DT JJ NN RB .
it connected those two people . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT CD NNS .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB VBN PRP IN NN NNS IN PRP VBD VBN VBN , CC DT NN VBZ DT RB JJR CC RBR NN TO NN NNS .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities . [ pos tagging ] WRB CD NN VBZ DT , PRP VBP PRP$ NNS .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ NN , PRP RB VBZ DT NN IN NN .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics . [ pos tagging ] RB CD IN DT JJ NNS PRP VBP TO VB IN NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN NNS .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other . [ pos tagging ] CC JJS NNS VBP IN , CC PRP VBP IN CD VBZ DT NN TO DT JJ .
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ NN TO DT NN IN NN VBZ VBG .
now how many times have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader ele@@ cted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB JJ NNS VBP PRP VBD DT JJ NN : CC RB PRP VBP DT NN IN NN VBG DT JJ JJ NN VBN : CC RB PRP VBP RB CC PRP VBP NN TO VB PRP$ NNS CC VB PRP$ NNS , CC RB RB IN JJ NNS .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ in@@ ch layer on top . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ JJ NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN CC NNS VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ IN DT VBZ WP PRP VBP NN .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP IN NN IN JJ NN .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that kee@@ ps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN NN WDT VBZ DT NN IN PRP JJ CC PRP VBP IN IN NN WDT VBZ VBG IN PRP , DT JJ NN , CC RB PRP VBP VBG PRP .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP TO VB NNS VBZ JJ .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN TO VB IN PRP , PRP VBP VBG TO VB TO VB NN NN .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ WRB DT JJ NN IN NN NNS .
we have to engage with the machin@@ ery of government . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN IN NN .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done . [ pos tagging ] IN DT VBZ JJ NN VBZ VBN .
have you seen these guys ? [ pos tagging ] VB PRP VBN DT NNS .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s requ@@ est for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS WDT VBP VBN DT RB JJ JJ NN WDT VBZ DT NN TO DT NN POS NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN NN .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB VBG RB JJ , DT VBZ VBG RB JJ .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT IN PRP WP VBP VBN RP IN NN , PRP VBZ NN IN PRP VBD PRP IN DT NN IN PRP VBP TO VB IN PRP$ NNS .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBP VBG TO NN .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ? [ pos tagging ] VBP PRP RB VBP PRP VBP VBG TO VB WRB PRP VBP TO VB IN VBG DT CD NN WDT MD VB IN NN IN DT IN PRP .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB VB IN NN , CC PRP VBP VB PRP TO VB RBR JJ .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN NN VBZ VBG PRP JJ TO RB VB DT NN IN NN IN DT NN WDT MD RB VB IN VBG JJ NN .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ DT NN IN RB DT VBZ VBN RP IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP IN PRP VBZ RB DT JJ TO VB NNS RB , PRP RB VBP TO VB DT NNS DT JJ NN .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS VBZ CD , RB JJ VBP , RB , RB DT NN JJR IN JJS IN PRP .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN RP VBG PRP$ NNS RB RB IN VBN .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VBG IN NN IN PRP VBP DT VBG IN WP VBZ TO VB : PRP DT VBP TO VB .
they can express their opini@@ on on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices . [ pos tagging ] RB WRB PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP '' NN IN JJ IN VBG PRP$ NNS .
they &apos;re using their hands . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NNS .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NNS TO VB NNS WDT VBP NN NN RBR .
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS VBP PRP VB PRP$ NNS TO VB PRP$ NNS RBR .
that could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a g@@ arb@@ age can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB VBG RP DT NN , VBG DT NN , VBG RP DT NN MD IN DT NN IN PRP .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP MD VB VBN VBG RP DT NN NNS DT RB , CC JJ NNS VBP .
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS VBP JJ JJ JJ NNS IN PRP VBP RB RB NNS , CC PRP VBP RB RB NNS IN NN , VBG IN PRP$ NNS CC VBG RB NNS .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJR IN DT , PRP VBP NNS .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP RB VBG TO VB NN IN PRP VBP NN .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ? [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN NN VBP IN DT IN PRP RB : WRB PRP VBZ TO DT JJ , JJ NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB RB , DT IN PRP RB , VBP PRP RB VBG TO VB DT NN IN NNS , CC VBP PRP RB VBG TO VB DT NN IN NNS .
thank you . [ pos tagging ] NN PRP .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ RB VBP DT NN IN VBG TO VB TO NNS WRB JJ DT JJ NNS WDT VBP VBG RB VBP VBG TO VB , CC VB VBD IN , IN NN VBD IN NNS RB , NNS MD VB PRP WP VBP RB VBP CC VBP TO VB RB CC VB TO VB WP VBZ RB VBG IN RB IN DT VBG NNS IN NN WDT VBP RB RB IN PRP MD RB VB IN NN IN PRP .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP VBG TO VB RP IN VBG RB CD RB JJ NN NN .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , RB IN PRP MD RB VB IN DT NN WDT VBZ IN .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fi@@ le . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN NN VBD IN IN PRP$ NN .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it . [ pos tagging ] WP NN VBP TO VB PRP VBZ RB RB JJ DT NNS IN DT NN , CC DT JJ NN IN PRP .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ TO VB DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBD VBG IN DT NN IN NN NNS VBP DT NN IN JJ NN NNS .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN , IN RB JJ NN NNS IN PRP VBP VBN TO , VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magni@@ tude in performance scale . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NNS , DT NN RB VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NN NN .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP IN NN IN JJ NNS .
something really weird is going on here . [ pos tagging ] NN RB JJ VBZ VBG IN RB .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB WP VB VBP VBG TO VB VBG IN .
so , if you could bring up the lights . [ pos tagging ] RB , IN PRP MD VB RP DT NNS .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB RP DT NNS JJR , IN JJ VBP RB VBG TO VB DT NN IN NN RB .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB VBP PRP VB NN NNS IN NN NNS .
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN VBZ , IN JJ VBD PRP IN DT JJ NN WRB , VB POS VB , DT VBZ NNS , DT VBZ NN IN DT NN , CC DT VBZ JJ NN IN DT NN IN JJ VBP VBG TO VB , DT NN NN NN IN NN .
they sort of go like this . [ pos tagging ] PRP NN IN NN IN DT .
and they don &apos;t tell us much . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP '' VB PRP RB .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NN , IN NN , DT JJ NN , VBP NN NN , IN DT JJ NN , PRP MD VB RB JJ , PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB NN IN DT VBZ , NNS VBP RB VBG .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN NN VBD VBG RB RB RB IN NN NN , RB DT NN IN NN , NN MD VB JJ TO VB IN DT NN NN CC VB IN NN IN CD NNS .
it &apos;s not moving like that . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB VBG IN DT .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ eding growth where you go by orders of magni@@ tude every few years . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ NN VBN IN DT NN IN NN NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN WRB PRP VBP IN NNS IN NN DT JJ NNS .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN JJ MD VB TO VB VBZ , IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NNS , PRP VBP '' VBP IN NN .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are . [ pos tagging ] NNS RB MD VB RB VB VBG RB RB IN PRP VBP .
one of two things is going to happen . [ pos tagging ] CD IN CD NNS VBZ VBG TO VB .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ VBG TO VB IN DT NN IN JJ NN IN DT , IN NN RB JJ VBZ RB , CC RB PRP VBZ VBG TO VB DT .
that &apos;s about all it can do . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN DT PRP MD VB .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP DT NN , IN JJ NN IN NN PRP VBZ RB VBG TO VB NN IN DT .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition . [ pos tagging ] IN RB , DT VBZ IN WP PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN RB VBZ DT NN .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NN IN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN DT NN VBN TO VB TO DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ? [ pos tagging ] CC RB WP JJ VBP VBG TO VB , WP VBD VBP VBN VBG PRP , VBZ WP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ VBG IN .
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN VBZ RB , RB VBG WRB PRP VBP JJ IN DT NN IN PRP .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 . [ pos tagging ] RB WRB NN VBD DT NN VBG RP , DT NN VBD NN IN DT NN CD , CC NNS VBN TO VB IN WP MD VB IN DT NN CD .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBZ DT NN IN WDT NNS VBP IN DT NN , CC PRP VBP IN DT NN VBZ RB IN IN DT NN CD .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ IN RB RB IN PRP VBP RP .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NNS , DT NN VBZ NN IN VBN VBG CD NN IN NN IN PRP$ JJ NN .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP IN DT NN VBZ IN PRP DT VBP IN NN POS VBG RB .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG . PRP MD DT VB PRP .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP IN PRP RB VBZ JJ VB RB JJ NN TO VB RP CD , CD NNS IN NN VBZ VBG TO VB RB JJ IN DT JJ NN IN WP PRP VBP VBG RB VB NNS VBP DT NN IN DT .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through . [ pos tagging ] IN WP NN MD VB TO VB IN VBZ WP DT MD VB , WP IN NN MD VB IN PRP VBP VBG IN .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN TO VB IN VB VBP VBG TO VB TO VB IN DT NN IN NN WDT RB VBZ NN TO VB IN NN CC NNS .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ VBP DT JJ NN TO VB DT VBZ TO RB VB RB CC VB DT JJ NN JJ NN IN NNS .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN IN NN MD VB TO VB IN DT IN VBZ DT NN NN IN NN IN NN .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP DT NN VBZ NN IN PRP VBP IN PRP DT JJ CD NNS IN DT NN .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , ster@@ i@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP RB RB CD CC DT JJ CD NNS , DT NN VBD DT JJ , JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN IN NNS VBG RB IN PRP .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT NNS VBD VBN , PRP VBP TO VB DT RB JJ NN IN WRB PRP VBP PRP .
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP IN EX VBZ NNS WDT VBP VBG TO VB IN WRB PRP VBD IN NN , CC JJ VBP VBG TO VB DT NN IN JJ NN IN PRP , WDT VBZ IN , IN DT NN , EX VBD JJ NNS IN NN VBG IN IN DT NNS IN JJ NNS IN NNS IN PRP .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpo@@ rate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil . [ pos tagging ] CC DT IN DT NNS IN NN VBD DT JJ NN IN NNS IN PRP WDT VBD PRP TO VB NNS IN DT JJ CC VB DT NNS IN NN .
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de . [ pos tagging ] CC DT WDT VBD IN DT VBD TO VB CC VB .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD DT RBS JJ NNS IN NNS IN DT NN , DT JJ NNS IN NN .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NNS IN NN NNS POS RB JJ , IN PRP VBP PRP RB , IN DT CD IN PRP VBD DT JJ JJ NN IN NNS .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemicals within them . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN PRP VBD , PRP VBD NN IN JJ NN IN DT NNS IN PRP .
and so every drop was a little bit different . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT NN VBD DT JJ NN JJ .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated more chemicals and divi@@ ded more . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , DT NNS WDT VBD JJ IN DT NN WDT VBD PRP TO VB JJR IN JJ NNS IN PRP , VBD RBR CC VBN JJR NNS CC VBD RBR .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBN TO VB JJR , VB VBN RBR .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ NN IN RB DT RB JJ JJ NN IN NN , CC WRB NNS VBD VBG VBD WRB DT NNS VBD DT NN IN NN .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NNS IN PRP VBP JJ RB VBP , DT JJ NNS VBD TO VB RP NN .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD TO VB DT NN WDT VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN VBN NN .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NNS , PRP VBD RP , IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN , DT NN IN VBG DT VBD PRP VB RP WP PRP VBD , IN IN DT NN IN VBG PRP RP MD VB VBN .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN IN VBG VBZ TO VB VBN JJ IN PRP VBD CD CC DT JJ CD NNS RB .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing . [ pos tagging ] IN NN DT NN IN PRP , PRP$ NNS , VBZ RB IN JJ NN CC DT JJ NN IN NN .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , DT NN NN VBZ VBN IN RB DT JJ NN IN NNS CC DT JJ NN .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , CD IN DT NNS IN NN VBD RB IN JJ NNS VBZ PRP MD RB VB NNS IN DT NN .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP VBN RB DT JJ CD NNS IN JJ NN , WDT VBP VBP RB TO VB DT NN NNS VBP IN NNS .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ IN PRP : WP NN VBD VBZ JJ VBD DT NN : DT NN VBZ VBN NNS IN PRP VBP IN VBG PRP : CC JJ VBD PRP$ NN NN IN DT NN IN NN CC VBD PRP CD TO DT CD NNS .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ ent@@ y for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .

if i had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and rele@@ ased it in the room . [ pos tagging ] IN VBN VBD RB VBN DT NN , NN MD VB VBN PRP IN DT NN CC VBD PRP IN DT NN .
so what was the next step ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBD DT JJ NN .
writing down the dna was an interesting step . [ pos tagging ] VBG RP DT NN VBD DT JJ NN .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD DT NNS : DT VBD PRP JJ IN DT CD NNS .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells . [ pos tagging ] CC RB EX VBD DT RB JJ NN WRB NNS VBD RB JJ , WDT VBZ DT NNS VBD VBG CC VBG NN , IN IN PRP VBD TO VB NNS IN NNS .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS VBP IN PRP VBP DT , CC NNS MD RB VB NN .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ WRB , IN NN , JJ NN VBZ VBN .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because bacteria communicate . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBD RP WRB TO VB RB IN NN , CC PRP VBD IN NN IN VBG PRP$ JJ JJ NN IN JJ NNS , CC RB PRP VBP DT NN IN NNS WDT VBP JJ TO VB , IN NN NN .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic . [ pos tagging ] RB WP DT NN VBD VBD NNS TO VB DT , IN DT NN , VBD IN DT JJ NN RB : PRP VBD JJ .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBD CC PRP VBD RB , WDT VBZ IN IN DT NN VBD RB JJ , PDT DT NNS IN DT NN VBD VBN RBR CC PRP VBD VBN IN NN .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of dna . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN NN VBD WRB DT NNS VBD RB JJ IN , IN NN , PRP VBD RB CC VBD TO VB RP DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB IN CD NN IN NN .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years . [ pos tagging ] CC RB DT JJ NN WDT VBZ NN IN NN VBD IN DT CD NNS .
and at that stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN , PRP VBP JJ NNS , NNS IN NNS IN JJ NNS IN NNS , VBG RB IN DT JJ NN .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , PRP VBP JJ DT JJ NN .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS IN NNS WDT VBP RB IN IN PRP RB .
your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN NN VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN NN , NN NN , DT NN NN CC RB IN .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS VBD TO VB RB IN DT JJ NN IN WDT NN VBD VBG NN VBD RB JJR DT NN , CC DT NN WDT PRP VBP DT NN .
now the next step that happened is within these communities . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NN WDT VBD VBZ IN DT NNS .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstra@@ ct information . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS IN NNS , RB , VBD TO VB NN .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD VBG RB JJ NNS WDT VBD NN CC NN NN IN DT NN .
and those are the neu@@ ral structures . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBP DT JJ NNS .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up . [ pos tagging ] IN NNS VBP DT NN NN NN IN DT NNS IN NNS VBN RP .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , PRP VBD TO VB NNS IN DT NN CC JJ NNS WDT VBD JJ IN VBG , VBG , VBG NN .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD DT NNS CC DT JJ NN IN DT NNS .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD PRP DT JJ NN .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN , DT NN : NN MD VB IN DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN , RB IN IN DT JJ NN NN .
so an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN MD , IN NN , VBZ RB TO VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN PRP VBD JJ CC PRP VBD JJ JJ NN PRP VBD PRP .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , WP IN PRP MD VBN DT JJ NN NN NNS , WDT MD VB VBN TO VB VBN RB IN NNS IN NNS IN NNS IN DT NNS VBG RP DT NN WDT NN IN NN .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NN , DT NN IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN NNS , IN NN MD RB VB IN DT NN .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN JJ NN NNS .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic@@ ating . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WP VBD VBD DT NNS VBN RP , IN NN , NNS IN NN .
and for example , the most sophisti@@ cated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , DT RBS JJ NN IN PRP VBP JJ IN VBZ JJ NN .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB DT NN JJ NN IN PRP VBP IN PRP .
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head . [ pos tagging ] RB NNS VBP DT RB VBN , FW , VBD NN IN PRP$ NN .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully con@@ struc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analog@@ y to it . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG RB VBG VBG NNS RB , CC RB VBG DT JJ NN , VBD NN IN PRP$ NN IN VBZ DT NN TO PRP .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP VBG NN RB VBN , VBG PRP IN NN , NNS IN NNS , CC VBG NN RB VBN IN PRP$ NN .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tion@@ ing as a single organis@@ m . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ PRP RB TO VB TO VB NN IN DT JJ NN .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ cting out . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , IN NN , WP PRP VBP VBN VBZ PRP , NN , VBP VBN VBG RP .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing information . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG IN DT JJ NNS IN JJ NNS VBP VBN IN : VBG RP PRP$ NNS IN NN , VBG , VBG NN .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , DT NN IN NN VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information . [ pos tagging ] NN , NNS , NNS , NNS CC RB IN VBP DT PRP$ VBN NNS IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN PRP$ NN IN VBG DT NN .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP DT VBZ PRP RB IN NN WDT VBZ RB JJR CC JJ JJR CC JJ TO VB IN WP PRP VBD RB .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds . [ pos tagging ] RB RB , NN MD VB NN IN DT NN IN NNS .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD EX POS JJ JJ NN WRB PRP NN IN VBD DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN NN NN IN PRP$ NNS .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again . [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP VBP VBN RP DT NN VBZ RB RB .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NNS IN DT NN IN NN VBD PRP IN VBD DT CD NNS DT NN .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NNS , IN JJ NNS CC NNS , VBD DT JJ CD CD NNS .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years . [ pos tagging ] RB DT JJ NNS , IN NN CC RB IN , VBD JJR IN DT CD NNS .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NNS , IN NNS , VBP TO VB VBG RB DT JJ NNS .
the process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG IN PRP CC VBG , JJ NN , JJ VBZ DT NN IN PRP : WRB NN VBZ PRP$ NN IN NN .
the more it changes , the faster it changes . [ pos tagging ] DT JJR PRP VBZ , DT NN PRP VBZ .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP IN DT VBZ WP PRP VBP VBG RB IN DT NN IN NN .
we &apos;re seeing this process fe@@ eding back on itself . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG DT NN VBG RB IN PRP .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanis@@ ms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NN NNS IN DT NN , CC NN VBP IN DT NN IN NN VBP TO VB NNS MD VB JJ IN JJ NNS IN NNS .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense . [ pos tagging ] RB RB RB , WP NN VBP VBZ JJ NN NNS IN JJ NN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ IN PRP TO VB PRP IN DT JJ NN .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP POS VBP WP DT NN IN DT NN NN VBZ .
there are billions of them . [ pos tagging ] EX VBP NNS IN PRP .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do . [ pos tagging ] RB , WP VB VBP CC WP DT NNS IN VBG NNS VBP VBZ PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN CC RB PRP NN PRP TO DT NN CC DT NN VBZ PRP IN WP PRP MD RB VB , VB JJR CC RBR IN PRP MD RB VB .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , VBZ PRP VBZ PRP IN NNS IN PRP VBP '' RB RB VBP .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself . [ pos tagging ] CD NN WDT VBZ RB JJ IN JJ VBP VBN VBG DT NN RB VBZ JJ PRP .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale . [ pos tagging ] RB WP PRP VBP VBZ PRP VBD IN DT NN DT NN IN NN WDT VBZ NN IN DT NN NN NN .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , IN DT RBS JJ NNS , PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN VBG RP IN JJ NNS IN NNS .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions . [ pos tagging ] VB , `` NN , MD PRP VB VB DT CD CD JJ NNS IN NNS .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what i wanted . &quot; [ pos tagging ] RB MD PRP VB VB DT IN DT JJ NNS IN NNS , VBP DT IN DT NNS , CC VB RP DT NNS WDT VBD JJS TO VBG WP NN VBD . ``
so in other words , i define what i wanted . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NNS , JJ VBP WP NN VBD .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with . [ pos tagging ] NN POS VB NN VBP TO VB NNS , IN DT JJ NN NN VBP VBN PRP IN .
so find the programs that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers . [ pos tagging ] RB VB DT NNS WDT VBP JJS TO VBG NNS .
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , JJ NNS IN NNS VBP RB JJ TO VB NNS , IN NN IN PRP MD RB VB PRP .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN PRP , IN NN , MD VB CD NNS IN DT JJ NN .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job . [ pos tagging ] CC NNS VBP , `` NN , MD PRP VB RB VBP DT CD NN IN DT JJ NNS WDT VBD DT JJS NN .
save those . kill off the rest . [ pos tagging ] VB DT . VB RP DT NN .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VB POS VB DT NNS WDT VBD NNS DT JJS .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analog@@ ous to sex . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC VB POS VB PRP IN DT NN IN NN JJ TO VB . ``
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs . [ pos tagging ] VB CD NNS CC PRP VBP NNS IN VBG PRP$ NNS , CC DT NNS VBP DT NNS IN DT NNS IN DT CD NNS .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP VBN RB DT JJ NN IN NNS WDT VBP VBN IN NNS IN DT NNS WDT VBD DT JJ NN RBR NN .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot; [ pos tagging ] VB , `` VB NN IN NN . ``
sc@@ ore them again . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP RB .
introdu@@ ce some mu@@ tations perhaps . [ pos tagging ] VB DT NNS RB .
and try that again and do that for another generation . [ pos tagging ] CC VB DT RB CC VBP DT IN DT NN .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds . [ pos tagging ] RB DT CD IN DT NNS RB VBZ DT JJ NNS .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ MD VB DT NN IN NNS IN NNS IN NN IN DT IN DT NN IN DT JJ NNS , CC IN DT JJ NNS , IN DT JJ NNS .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN IN DT , JJ VBP RP IN NNS WDT VBP RB JJ IN VBG NNS .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , PRP VBP NNS WDT VBP RB RBR JJ IN NNS NNS MD VB RB VBN IN NN .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ VBP IN DT NNS , NNS MD VB VB PRP WRB PRP VBP .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN VBG IN PRP CC VBG PRP WRB PRP VBP .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ , JJ NNS .
but they do the job . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT NN .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , NN VBP , JJ VBP RB JJ IN PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NNS IN NNS IN NNS WDT VBD DT NN .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , PRP$ NN VBN IN VBG DT NN .
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD VBG IN DT CD IN NN NN RB , CC PRP VBZ RP DT NN CC VBZ , `` JJ NN . NN IN DT .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ , '' DT NN VBZ NNS IN NNS IN JJ NNS VBG RB TO VB PRP DT JJ NN . '' JJ POS WDT VBP PRP VB JJ . ``
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , PRP VBP IN DT NN NN NN POS NN RB RB WRB PRP VBZ VBN .
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP VBG TO VB IN NNS TO VB DT NN WDT VBZ RB JJ IN NN .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ PRP VB NNS IN RB JJR NN IN JJ NN NNS PRP VBP .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the op@@ tions of it . [ pos tagging ] CC RB , PRP VBP JJ RB VBP DT NNS IN PRP .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us . [ pos tagging ] RB IN DT NN , PRP VBZ VBG RB IN PRP .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VBG DT NNS TO VB JJ JJR NNS IN IN PRP MD VB JJ TO VB DT NN JJ RBR .
so it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ VBG RB IN PRP .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBG RBR CC DT VBZ WRB JJ VBP PRP VBZ RB JJ .
because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves . [ pos tagging ] IN DT IN DT NNS VBP VBG RB IN PRP .
we &apos;re taking off . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG RP .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBP VBZ PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN WDT VBZ JJ TO WRB JJ NNS VBD VBG IN JJ NNS .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN CC PRP MD VB RB NN RP WP DT NN DT NN VBZ PRP VBP VBG .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ IN DT NN IN NN .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP IN EX RB VBZ NN VBG RB IN PRP .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP PRP VBZ RB JJ IN PRP TO VB IN PRP VBP DT NN NN IN NN .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP DT IN PRP RB VBP DT NN IN VBG WDT IN JJ NN VBZ .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sel@@ ec@@ ted out . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBZ VBG RB , CC JJ VBP NN MD VB IN DT NN , IN JJ VBP VBN RP .
my story begins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBZ JJ RB RB IN JJ IN CD NNS RB .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN DT NN , IN DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN NN .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD IN NN IN WRB NN VBD VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ JJ NN `` DT NN . ``
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky . [ pos tagging ] RB RB IN DT NN , WRB PRP RB VBD TO VB PRP MD VB IN DT NN CC PRP MD VB IN DT NN .
now we do the same with air@@ planes . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ IN NNS .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bo@@ w , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .

now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT JJ IN NNS CC NNS .
the conclu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by machin@@ ery . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN PRP VBD TO VBD IN NN VBD VBN VBN IN NN .
and this made me really sad . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD PRP RB JJ .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP VBG DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD VBN IN DT NN IN NN MD VB DT NN TO VB CC VB DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NN IN PRP , IN VBG PRP TO PRP$ NNS .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD IN NN MD VB NNS , RB VB PRP .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch . [ pos tagging ] WRB NN VBD DT JJ NN , PRP$ NN VBD PRP PRP$ JJ JJ NN NN .
and this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing to me . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN IN JJ NN VBD DT RBS JJ NN TO PRP .
it became a gil@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN JJ IN NNS CC NNS CC NNS IN PRP$ NN .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our c@@ ameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP IN PRP$ NNS CC PRP$ JJ NNS CC PRP$ NNS VBD VBN PRP IN VBG .
they stopped us from being inspired . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP IN VBG VBN .
and so i jum@@ ped in , i jum@@ ped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBD IN , NN VBD IN DT NN IN NN , TO VB WRB NN MD VB PRP TO VB JJ IN VBN TO VB PRP .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBN VBG NNS IN NN VBD CD .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect re@@ a@@ ders all over the world . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WRB NN VBD DT NN , NN VBD PRP IN DT NN NN WDT MD VB NNS DT IN DT NN .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB WRB PRP VBP VBG PRP .
it can know where we are . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB WRB PRP VBP .
it brings together image and text and anima@@ tion and sound and touch . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ RB NN CC NN CC NN CC NN CC NN .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sensor@@ ial . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ VBG RBR CC JJR JJ .
but what are we doing with it ? [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBP PRP VBG IN PRP .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and laun@@ ch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the i@@ pad . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP RB RB VBG TO VB IN CC JJ NN , DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBZ , `` VB PRP$ NNS IN DT NN . ``
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name . [ pos tagging ] CC RB : PRP VBZ , `` DT NN VBZ TO : `` CC RB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
and actually i become a character in the book . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJ VBP DT NN IN DT NN .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually add@@ ressed to me . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NNS , DT JJ NN VBZ RB TO PRP : CC DT NN VBZ WRB PRP VBP IN IN NN : WDT VBZ RB VBN TO PRP .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN PRP VBZ RB VBN IN DT NNS IN NNS .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ VBP VBN VBG DT NN IN NN .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all h@@ arb@@ or@@ ed as children . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ NN POS NN NNS CC NNS , JJ VBP DT NN IN NN NN , DT NNS IN PRP DT VBD IN NNS .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NNS IN DT NN , IN DT NN , VBD RB RB VBG TO PRP .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fire@@ flies out . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN RB PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NN , VBP DT NNS RP .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP RB VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain@@ ed within a single mar@@ ble . [ pos tagging ] DT NN WDT RB VBD PRP IN DT NN VBD IN DT JJ NN MD VB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gical device within the device . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN RB , DT NN CC DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN VBZ VBP IN TO DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
and it op@@ ens up a map . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RP DT NN .
all along , all fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic . [ pos tagging ] DT IN , DT VBP NNS VBP RB VBN NNS , CC DT NNS VBP VBN JJ .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ CC NNS CC VBZ PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ PRP TO PRP IN JJ NNS IN DT NN RB RB .

another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary . [ pos tagging ] DT NN WDT VBZ RB RB JJ TO PRP VBZ VBG NN WDT VBZ JJ CC RB RB JJ .

[ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT NN IN NNS CC PRP VBP DT NN IN NN , CC WRB JJ NNS IN IN NN VBP IN PRP$ JJ NNS , DT NNS .
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS VBP VBN VBN IN NN POS NNS IN NNS IN NNS IN DT JJ CC JJ NN .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP VBG PRP RB IN DT JJ NN IN NNS .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN WDT RB VBZ IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .

but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN JJ NN , PRP MD RB VB PRP$ NNS IN IN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and collect pictures of different natural objects . [ pos tagging ] CD IN DT NNS IN DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBP VBN RP IN DT JJS WRB PRP VBP TO VB JJ , VB RP PRP$ NN IN DT NN CC JJ NNS IN JJ JJ NNS .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ells . [ pos tagging ] WRB NN VBD DT NN , NN VBD JJ NNS IN NNS CC NNS CC NNS CC NNS .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore . [ pos tagging ] CC VB NNS VB CD VBP DT NN .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then tag it . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG RP DT NN JJ , PRP VBP TO VB RB CC , IN CD NN , VB DT NN IN DT NN CC RB VB PRP .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN DT NN IN NN CC RB VB DT .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put up online . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBZ VBZ IN PRP RB VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN PRP MD RB VB RP NN .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBZ RP DT NN IN DT NN CC VBZ , `` UH , JJ VBD DT NN NN . ``
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBZ , `` NN VBD DT NN NN . ``
and it creates this kind of social network around a colle@@ ction of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN IN PRP VBP RB VBN .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS IN VBG RB JJ , DT NN CC NN , EX VBP JJ NNS .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ pad out with the video on and through aug@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anima@@ ted pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .

at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves . [ pos tagging ] IN CD NN , PRP$ NN VBZ VBN RP IN NNS .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN NN CC VB PRP RB CC VB DT NN IN DT NN .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG , PRP VBP DT VBG RB , TO DT NN WRB DT NNS IN NN VBN RBR RB TO NN , CC JJ CC NN MD VB JJR RB .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG NN IN DT NN .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NNS CC PRP JJR TO DT JJ NN CC DT NN CC NN CC NN NN IN PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN .

well this is a really extraordinary honor for me . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN PRP .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pris@@ ons , on death row . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP JJS IN PRP$ NN IN NNS , IN NNS , IN NN NN .

and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity . [ pos tagging ] CC CD IN DT NNS WDT VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN RB VBZ IN VBN VBZ DT NN .
and you can actually say things here that have im@@ pac@@ ts around the world . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD RB VB NNS RB DT VBP NNS IN DT NN .

and i mention that because i think identity is really important . [ pos tagging ] CC VB NN IN IN NN VBP NN VBZ RB JJ .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP VBD DT JJ NNS .

and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBP POS NN IN DT RB VBG NN CC VBG DT NN WDT VBZ VBP .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother . [ pos tagging ] NNS RB VBD IN DT IN PRP$ NN .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RP IN DT NN WDT VBD DT JJ JJ JJ NN WDT VBD VBN IN DT NN , CC IN NN VBD PRP$ NN .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ , PRP VBD JJ , PRP VBD JJ .
she was the end of every argument in our family . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS IN PRP$ NN .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD DT NN IN NNS WP VBD RB VBN .

my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NN VBD DT JJS IN PRP$ CD NNS .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention . [ pos tagging ] CC RB WRB NN MD VB CC VB NN IN PRP , PRP MD VB JJ TO VB PRP$ NN CC NN .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ NNS MD VB VBG RB RB .

it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ , DT NN IN DT NN NN .

that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless impli@@ cated . [ pos tagging ] IN WRB PRP RB VBP JJ NN IN DT JJ NNS , DT JJ CC JJ NNS VBP RB VBN .

there is a program that some of you might have heard of . [ pos tagging ] EX VBZ DT NN IN DT IN PRP MD VB VBN IN .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN VBN NN .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ attle . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD IN IN DT NN IN NN IN NN .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ DT NN WRB NNS MD RB VB DT NN IN JJ NNS CC NN RP WRB DT NN VBZ VBG TO VB .
and how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB PRP VBZ VBZ PRP$ NN CC PRP$ NN .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB JJ IN NN IN NN .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem . [ pos tagging ] CC RB IN RB , PRP VBZ VBN DT NN NN .
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ VBN VBN IN NN NNS CC RB JJ .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB , NNS IN NNS IN NNS VBD JJ CC VBD VBG PRP .

and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ hab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .

it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN JJ NN .

that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted sa@@ f@@ ely , hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ IN NN VBD RB , VBD RB CD NNS IN IN CD IN NNS .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dro@@ pped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .

in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ man would study for a blood test . [ pos tagging ] IN JJ NN , DT NN RB VBD IN JJ NN MD VB IN DT NN NN .

and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD RB , NNS VBD IN NNS , JJ NN .

[ pos tagging ] CC VB VBD IN IN JJ NN IN DT NN IN IN JJ VBD NN CC VBD NN , CC RB JJ IN JJ , IN JJ TO NN IN JJ , IN PRP MD VB PRP IN VBG NNS .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ cker . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD IN DT NN , IN JJ VBD JJ NN .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD DT NN IN DT NN NN RB IN NN WRB NN NN VBD VBN TO DT NN NN IN DT NN WRB NN VBD VBG .
at the time i was as@@ sig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN VBD VBN TO DT NN NN IN DT NN NN .
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f called for a car@@ di@@ ology consu@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD PRP$ NN , WRB DT NN NN VBN IN DT NN NN , TO VB DT NN IN NN .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding . [ pos tagging ] CC TO VB RB TO PRP$ NN .
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD NN NN , CC PRP VBD NN .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB NN VBD TO PRP$ , PRP VBD VBG DT JJ NN .
and when i listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure . [ pos tagging ] CC WRB NN VBD TO PRP$ NN IN DT NN , NN MD VB JJ NNS IN DT NNS WDT VBD PRP IN PRP VBD IN JJ NN NN .
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the l@@ ung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .

and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBP VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB .
i made it and i set to work tre@@ ating her . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP CC VB VBN TO VB VBG PRP .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP$ NN . NN VBD PRP$ NNS TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN .

and i felt really good . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBD RB JJ .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ WRB NN VBD PRP$ JJ NN : JJ VBD PRP$ NN .
actually , i made two more mistakes . [ pos tagging ] RB , JJ VBD CD JJR NNS .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP$ NN IN VBG TO PRP$ NN .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP CD NN RP DT NN CC VB WP VB VBD VBN TO VB , WDT VBD VB PRP$ NN CC VB DT NN IN PRP RB PRP MD VB DT NN TO VB PRP$ IN PRP .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ nis@@ h addi@@ tional information about her . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD PRP , PRP MD VB VBN JJ TO VB JJ NN IN PRP .
maybe i did it for a good reason . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBD PRP IN DT JJ NN .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBP POS VBP TO VB DT JJ NN .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VBD TO VB RB JJ CC RB JJ TO VB NN IN NN MD VB RB CC VB MD VB JJ TO VB NN IN PRP$ NN POS NNS IN RB VBG TO VB PRP .
the second mistake that i made was worse . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN IN NN VBD VBD JJR .
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN VBG PRP$ NN , NN VBD DT JJ NN RB RP RB DT VBD VBG TO VB PRP , `` NN , RB DT JJ NN . VB JJ VB DT . ``
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was i that i actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN NN , RB VBG IN NN VBD JJ IN VBP RB VBN DT NN WP VBD VBG IN NN NN , `` VBP PRP VB PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP VBZ RB . ``

i can remember that like it was yesterday . [ pos tagging ] NN MD VB IN IN PRP VBD NN .

but i car@@ ried on with my work . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBD IN IN PRP$ NN .

i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN NN .
and it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know dre@@ ad .

the three words are : do you remember ? [ pos tagging ] DT CD NNS VBP : VB PRP VB .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; [ pos tagging ] `` VBP PRP VB IN NN PRP VBD NN . ``

she had ir@@ rever@@ si@@ ble brain damage . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD JJ NN NN .

and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother . [ pos tagging ] CC IN IN DT CD NN NN , PRP VBD PRP VB : NN NN , DT NN , DT NN CC DT NN .

and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBD PRP$ JJ NN TO VB VBN IN DT .

if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .

that &apos;s the system that we have . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBP .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNS .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .

and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB IN DT JJ NN , IN DT NNS VBP TO VB DT NN .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP DT NN IN IN PRP VBP DT NNS WP VBP NNS IN IN NN , WP MD PRP VB VBN IN , CC DT JJ NN .
but there are two problems with that . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBP CD NNS IN DT .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything i can , from one of the first artic@@ les i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN PRP$ CD NNS CC RB IN JJ NN CC NN , NN VBP VBN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN CC JJ NNS TO VB NN NN MD , IN CD IN DT JJ NNS VBP VBD IN DT NN NN TO PRP$ NN `` JJ NN , JJ NN . ``
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous . [ pos tagging ] CC WP VBP VBP VBN VBZ IN NNS VBP RB JJ .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medic@@ ation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .

in this country , as many as 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , RB JJ IN CD NNS NN IN JJ JJ NNS .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ g@@ ged it at 100,000 . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NNS , DT NN IN NN VBD PRP IN CD .

and here &apos;s the thing . [ pos tagging ] CC RB VBZ DT NN .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN NN WRB JJ NN VBZ VBG DT CD CC CD NNS , PRP MD VB VB RP IN PRP .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] JJ NN VBZ RB JJ .
we can &apos;t get rid of it . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB VB JJ IN PRP .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP$ JJ NNS , IN IN NN MD VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN NN .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t . [ pos tagging ] RB VBP DT JJ NN IN NN NN , VB PRP VB CC JJ CC VBD DT JJ NN IN NN IN PRP$ NN , CC RB PRP$ NN VBZ VBN IN NN .
i don &apos;t take the same history . [ pos tagging ] JJ VBP NNS VBP DT JJ NN .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP RB DT NN : JJ VBP MD VB NNS DT JJ NN DT NN .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way each time . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NNS VBP CD NNS : PRP VBP '' VB PRP PRP$ NNS IN DT JJ NN DT NN .
given all of that , mistakes are inevi@@ table . [ pos tagging ] VBN DT IN DT , NNS VBP JJ .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP DT NN , IN NN VBD VBN , CC VBD RP PDT DT JJ NN NNS , RB EX VBD CC VB NN VBN .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ? [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP IN NN IN NNS RB VBG TO VB IN PRP$ JJS NNS .
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs to the ch@@ ie@@ f of car@@ di@@ a@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .

and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NNS MD VB , PRP MD VB , RB PRP MD VB RP CC VB JJ CC VB TO VB PRP PRP$ NNS .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NNS . PRP VBP TO NN PRP$ NNS .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot; [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB JJ TO VB , `` NN , NN NNS VBP DT JJ NN NN VBD . ``
what they need is an environment to be able to do that . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBP VBZ DT NN TO VB JJ TO VB DT .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN CD NN IN DT NN .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBZ JJ , VBZ PRP VBZ JJ , VBZ PRP , VBZ POS NN IN VBG NNS , CC VBZ TO VB CD NN IN WP VBD IN PRP MD VB TO NN RB .
she shares her experience with others . [ pos tagging ] PRP NNS PRP$ NN IN NNS .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ JJ WRB JJ NNS VBP IN PRP$ NNS .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RP JJ NNS POS NNS , RB IN DT JJ NN , CC IN DT NN , JJ NN IN IN NN MD VB .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ IN DT NN IN NN IN VBZ IN JJ NNS VBP DT NN , CC WRB JJ NNS VBP DT NN , PRP MD VB NNS IN NN TO NN .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to dete@@ ct those mistakes that humans inevi@@ t@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .

i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP JJ IN DT , CC RB VBP TO VB CD NN IN NN MD VB IN TO JJ NNS .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that . [ pos tagging ] NN RB VBZ MD VB WP PRP VBP IN PRP , CC NNS MD VB IN DT .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember . [ pos tagging ] CC VB PRP VB IN CD NNS IN PRP$ JJ : NN VBP VB .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB IN DT JJ , JJ NN .
and this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ eline . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ IN VBG NN .
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT NN MD VB VBN IN CD NN , NN MD VB PRP CD NNS IN TO VB IN DT NN .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJ NN VBZ IN NNS NNS , CD IN PRP$ NNS .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD RB , IN PRP VBP VB , IN POS CD .
and you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB PRP VBD VBG NNS , CC PRP VBZ POS .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB VBG JJ .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot; [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD CD IN PRP IN RB `` JJ . ``
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD DT JJ NN .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN VBD VBN IN PRP IN DT POS CD .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN VBZ IN DT NN JJ NN .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN , PRP VBP VBN PRP JJR IN NNS IN NNS CC JJ NNS , IN EX VBZ NN JJ IN PRP .
but the point is , we still come to gala@@ pa@@ gos . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ , PRP RB VBP TO VB .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP PRP VBZ JJ .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS RB VBP PRP VBZ JJ .
so what happens here ? [ pos tagging ] RB WP VBZ RB .
the second story , also to illu@@ strate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN , RB TO VB DT NN , VBZ VBN VBG NN .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa . [ pos tagging ] IN NN VBD RB IN '' CD , VBG DT NN IN NN NN .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD RB IN NN VBD RP IN NN CC NN VBD RBR TO VB IN NN .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBN NN MD VB IN .
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD DT JJ NN , CC NN VBD VBN IN NN VBD RB RB IN RB .
this was my first sun@@ burn . [ pos tagging ] DT VBD PRP$ JJ NN .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBD VBN IN NN NNS , IN PRP MD VB , CC DT JJ NN .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBD VBN IN CD NNS , DT NNS IN NN VBN NN NN .
and the fis@@ her@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in ghana . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS IN DT NN VBD NNS IN JJ CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN CC PRP VBD JJR IN NN IN NN .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of their size . [ pos tagging ] WRB JJ VBD RB CD NNS RB , DT NN VBD VBN TO NN IN PRP$ NN .
they were ma@@ turing at five centi@@ meters . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBG IN CD NNS .
they had been pus@@ hed gene@@ tically . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN VBN RB .
there were still fis@@ hes . [ pos tagging ] EX VBD RB NNS .
they were still kind of happy . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB NN IN JJ .
and the fish also were happy to be there . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN RB VBD JJ TO VB RB .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBZ VBN , CC NN VBZ VBN .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . [ pos tagging ] PRP$ JJ JJ NN VBZ IN NN VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN VBG IN JJ NN .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe did lots of development projects . [ pos tagging ] IN DT POS CD : RB , VBG IN DT POS CD : NN VBD NNS IN NN NNS .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ her@@ s and this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 . [ pos tagging ] NN NN VBD VBG IN NNS WDT VBD RB CD NNS CC DT NN , RB RB , VBZ VBN DT NN CD .
and i went sa@@ il@@ ing on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea . [ pos tagging ] CC VB VBD VBG IN PRP , CC PRP VBD NNS IN DT JJ JJ NN NN CC RB DT NN NN .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it . [ pos tagging ] CC WP PRP VBD , PRP VBP NNS VBP NNS IN PRP .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea . [ pos tagging ] WP PRP VBD , NNS VBP RB , VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom . [ pos tagging ] CC CD NN IN PRP$ NN VBD NNS , JJ NNS WDT VBP VBN IN DT NN .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish . [ pos tagging ] CC RB JJS IN DT NN , PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NN , DT NNS IN NN , VBD JJ NN NN .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN IN DT NN VBD IN DT NN CC RB VBD VBN RP .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very ra@@ pid . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NNS VBP JJ IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , PRP VBP DT NN CC RB JJ NN NNS .
the bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBZ VBN IN , IN DT NN , DT JJ NN CC JJ JJ IN DT JJ NN .
this is a dead tur@@ tle . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB VBN , PRP VBD VBN RB IN PRP VBD JJ .
and one time we caught a live one . [ pos tagging ] CC CD NN PRP VBD DT JJ NN .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD RB VBN RB .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBD TO VB PRP IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fis@@ hed . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NN VBZ RB VBN IN NNS DT NN PRP VBP IN DT NN WDT VBZ RB VBN VBN .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB VBN .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN , CC PRP VBP JJ VB PRP .
we ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP PRP$ NN TO DT JJ NN , CC PRP VBP '' VB WP VBD RB .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP VBP DT , NN IN DT VBZ .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN : NN , NNS IN NN , DT NN IN PRP$ NN , DT NN NN .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN PRP VBZ : PRP VBZ IN NNS VBP NNS , CC RB .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward . [ pos tagging ] DT NN MD VB DT NNS IN PRP VBD IN DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS IN DT NN CC MD VB NN .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss . [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN RB , PRP VBP IN DT NN .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP '' JJ WP VBD RB IN DT NN .
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN NNS .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN PRP VBP TO VB JJ NNS .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now . [ pos tagging ] CC DT , TO DT JJ NN , VBZ WP PRP VBP TO VB RB .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB NNS WDT VBP VBN CC NNS WDT VBP RB DT NN PRP VBD .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations . [ pos tagging ] RB CD MD VB DT NN VBD NNS RB WRB IN NN NNS , PRP VBD NNS CC PRP VBP '' VBP PRP VBD VBN RB IN DT JJ NNS .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant , before it gets extin@@ ct , it becomes rare . [ pos tagging ] IN , RB , DT NN WDT VBZ RB JJ , IN PRP VBZ JJ , PRP VBZ JJ .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP '' JJ JJ NNS .
you always lose rare animals . [ pos tagging ] PRP RB VBP JJ NNS .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss . [ pos tagging ] CC IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT JJ NN .
over time , we concent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , PRP VBP IN JJ NNS , CC IN DT NN WDT VBZ DT JJ NN .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ IN PRP VBP PRP .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline . [ pos tagging ] IN NN PRP VBP DT JJ NN VBD CC PRP VBP DT VBZ DT NN .
and the question is , why do people accept this ? [ pos tagging ] CC DT NN VBZ , WRB VBP NNS VB DT .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different . [ pos tagging ] RB IN PRP VBP '' VBP IN PRP VBD JJ .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different . [ pos tagging ] CC IN NN , NNS IN NNS , NNS , MD VB IN PRP VBD RB JJ .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP MD VB DT IN DT NN VBN IN DT JJR NN VBZ RB IN DT NN PRP MD VB DT NN VBD .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN NN , DT NN IN DT JJ , IN JJ JJ JJ NNS IN NN IN DT NN MD RB VB VBN CC VBZ RB RB VBN IN NN NNS , IN PRP VBZ RB `` JJ . ``
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN WRB NNS VBP CD VBP DT NN , RB IN PRP VBP IN NN NNS , IN PRP VBP JJ NN DT NNS IN DT NN .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBN NN MD VB .
because with marine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past . [ pos tagging ] IN IN NN VBN NNS , PRP RB VBP DT NN .

we have three main groups . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP CD JJ NNS .

these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .

mr. ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is . [ pos tagging ] NN NN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ : NN VBZ WRB PRP VBZ .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ VBP PRP VBZ RB NN IN PRP VBZ RBR JJ IN DT IN PRP TO VB DT NN IN DT NN NN IN RB IN DT JJ NN .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ RB JJ IN DT VBZ RB VBG TO VB JJR .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online . [ pos tagging ] IN DT NN , DT NN IN NN MD VB VBG PRP .
the second major group of attac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ JJ NN IN NNS IN PRP VBP VBG NN VBP RB VBN IN NN .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN IN NN RB : VBN IN NNS , VBN IN DT NN , VBN IN DT NNS .
groups like anony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attac@@ ks . [ pos tagging ] NNS IN JJ VBP VBN RP IN DT JJ CD NNS CC VBP VBN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN JJ NNS .
so those are the three main attac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks . [ pos tagging ] RB DT VBP DT CD JJ NNS : NNS WP VBP PRP IN DT NN , NNS IN JJ VBG PRP IN DT NN , CC RB DT JJ NN VBP NN NNS , NNS VBG DT NNS .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . [ pos tagging ] CC RB PRP VBP IN NNS IN WP VBD IN NN .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN WP VBZ WRB NNS VBP IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NNS : CC RB , PRP VBD .
it was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBG IN NN JJ NN IN PRP VBD VBN IN .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD IN CC PRP VBD PRP RB .
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people died because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] CC NN VBD JJ NN IN DT NN IN JJ NN NNS , NN VBD CD IN DT NNS IN DT NN IN PRP VBD JJ IN NNS VBD IN IN DT NN NN .
and his answer was yes . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP$ NN VBD RB .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ? [ pos tagging ] RB WRB JJ NNS VB IN DT NN IN DT NN IN DT .
well dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a . [ pos tagging ] RB NN VBZ DT NN .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ? [ pos tagging ] WP VBP PRP VB IN NNS .
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ mail . [ pos tagging ] RB PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP VBP DT NN WDT VBZ VBN , NN VBD NNS , NNS IN NN .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .

except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates . [ pos tagging ] CC VB NN NNS .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . [ pos tagging ] CC DT VBZ RB WP VBD IN DT NN IN NN .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ? [ pos tagging ] WP IN JJ NN CC NNS WDT VBP VBN VBG , IN NN , IN NN .
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police in apri@@ l 2011 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .

among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot; [ pos tagging ] IN DT NNS , VBD DT NN VBD `` RB . ``
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .

they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN DT NN IN CD NNS TO DT JJ NN .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here . [ pos tagging ] DT NN NN VBP RB RB .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NNS VBP VBG JJ NNS IN NNS TO VB DT IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well . [ pos tagging ] CC JJ NNS VBP VBG PRP TO PRP RB RB .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-@@ called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .

but today , it goes beyond that . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , PRP VBZ IN DT .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB PRP$ JJ NN .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .

now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .

this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security . [ pos tagging ] DT VBZ RB DT NN IN NN IN NN .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NN .

this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block . [ pos tagging ] DT MD VB JJ , CC VBP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fix@@ ed measu@@ re@@ ment that fit together . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NN NNS VBD VBN IN CD IN DT RB JJ NN : NNS VBN IN NN IN DT JJ NN WDT VBP RB .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world . [ pos tagging ] RB RB VB NNS VBD DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD PRP TO TO VB NNS WDT VBD JJR IN PRP , NNS , NNS , CD NN IN DT NN .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ NNS VBD VBN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN .
almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this . [ pos tagging ] RB DT CD NNS RB IN CD , NN VBD RB IN DT .
it was called the auto@@ matic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBD VBN DT JJ NN NN .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ se@@ hold . [ pos tagging ] CC IN DT JJ JJ NNS , NN NNS VBD NN IN DT NN .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ VBN IN IN CD CD NNS VBP VBN VBN : CC CD NNS IN DT NN IN DT NN .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP NNS VBP TO VB DT NN TO VB JJ NNS , JJ NNS , JJ NNS .
le@@ go made it acc@@ essi@@ ble . [ pos tagging ] NN VBD PRP JJ .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ RB VBN DT JJ NN , DT NN NN IN DT NN , CC VBD PRP IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block . [ pos tagging ] RB DT NN JJ NN , IN NN VBP DT JJ NN VBD IN TO VB VBN , DT JJ NN NN .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active . [ pos tagging ] DT NN VBD DT JJ NN NN WDT MD VB PRP IN DT NN IN JJ NNS VBN IN NN IN DT JJ TO DT NN WRB NN VBD JJ .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time . [ pos tagging ] IN DT JJ NN , DT NN VBZ PRP TO VB JJ JJR , RBR JJ NNS , CD NN IN DT NN .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts . [ pos tagging ] CC EX VBZ DT JJ NN : DT NN VBD RB IN NNS .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so i decided to change that . [ pos tagging ] NN RB JJ '' IN DT , IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ VBN IN NNS , IN RB VBD TO VB DT .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers . [ pos tagging ] CD NNS RB WRB NN VBD IN DT NNS NN , NN VBD VBG DT NN IN WRB TO VB DT NN IN NNS IN DT NNS IN NNS CC NNS .
a few years ago i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its . [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS RB RB VBD VBG NNS .
let me show you how they work . [ pos tagging ] VB PRP VB PRP WRB PRP VBP .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function . [ pos tagging ] NNS VBP JJ NNS IN DT CD JJ NN .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensor@@ s . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP JJ TO VB JJ , JJ , NNS CC NNS .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts . [ pos tagging ] CC DT JJS NN IN PRP VBZ PRP VBP RB IN NNS .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way . [ pos tagging ] IN PRP MD VB VB PRP DT JJ NN .
the bri@@ cks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded . [ pos tagging ] DT NNS VBP JJ .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange is wire . [ pos tagging ] NN VBZ NN , NN VBZ NN , NN VBZ VBN CC NN VBZ NN .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its . [ pos tagging ] RB RB PRP VBP TO VB VBZ VB DT NN TO DT JJ CC RB RB PRP MD VB VBG JJR NNS .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP DT NN TO DT JJ , PRP MD VB NN .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB DT NN IN IN CC RB PRP VBP VBN DT JJ NN .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker . [ pos tagging ] VB RP DT NN IN DT JJ NN , WDT VBZ RB , CC RB PRP VBP VBN DT JJ NN .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine . [ pos tagging ] VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN CC PRP VBP VBN DT NN NN .
i &apos;m going to stop that . [ pos tagging ] NN VBP VBG TO VB DT .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are actually pretty powerful . [ pos tagging ] RB IN JJ NN , NNS VBP RB RB JJ .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures . [ pos tagging ] RB IN VBG TO NN , TO VB , TO VB , NNS VBP PRP TO NN VBG RB JJ JJ NNS .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer . [ pos tagging ] RB TO VB DT NN RBR CC JJR , PRP MD RB VB DT NN CC RB VB PRP JJ RBR CC JJR .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library . [ pos tagging ] DT NN IN NNS VBZ IN PRP VBZ DT VBG NN .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ essi@@ ble . [ pos tagging ] NNS , VBZ , JJ NNS , NNS : NN MD VB JJ .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP VBN VBG NNS TO NNS CC VBG PRP VB IN PRP .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBZ VBN DT JJ NN .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools . [ pos tagging ] DT JJS NN VBZ WRB PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS IN PRP IN NN IN PRP VBP '' NN IN NNS .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch . [ pos tagging ] IN NN , WRB DT JJ NN , CC WRB DT NN NN VBZ JJ , CC WRB DT JJ NNS TO VB .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBP RB VBN VBG NNS TO VB NNS .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its as a material . [ pos tagging ] RB IN NN , PRP VBP VBD NNS IN DT NN IN NNS WDT VBP TO VB IN NNS IN DT NN .

a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot; [ pos tagging ] DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBD NNS TO VB CC VBD PRP TO DT NNS IN DT NN IN NN NN : RB NN , NN CC NN : CC VBD PRP `` VB NN . ``
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fett@@ i can@@ on ball . [ pos tagging ] RB VBZ DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBD , DT JJ NN NN NN .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project . [ pos tagging ] CC NN , DT VBZ RB PRP$ JJ NN .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark . [ pos tagging ] PRP VBZ DT NN VBN IN NN WDT VBZ NN IN DT NN .
to these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material . [ pos tagging ] TO DT NNS , NNS VBD DT NN , NNS VBD RB DT NN .
and we want to make this material acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone . [ pos tagging ] CC PRP VBP TO VB DT NN JJ TO NN .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open-@@ source . [ pos tagging ] RB JJ VBZ JJ .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself . [ pos tagging ] PRP MD VB IN DT NN , NN PDT DT NN VBZ , VB PRP PRP .
